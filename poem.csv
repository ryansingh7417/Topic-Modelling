0,0,James Thomson,shall the great soul of newton quit this earth  to mingle with his stars and every muse astonishd into silence shun the weight of honours due to his illustrious name but what can maneven now the sons of light in strains highwarbled to seraphic lyre hail his arrival on the coast of bliss yet am not i deterrd though high the theme and sung to harps of angels for with you ethereal flames ambitious i aspire in natures general symphony to join   and what new wonders can ye show your guest who while on this dim spot where mortals toil clouded in dust from motions simple laws could trace the secret hand of providence wideworking through this universal frame   have ye not listend while he bound the suns and planets to their spheres th unequal task of humankind till then oft had they rolld oer erring man the year and oft disgracd the pride of schools before their course was known full in its causes and effects to him allpiercing sage who sat not down and dreamd romantic schemes defended by the din of specious words and tyranny of names but bidding his amazing mind attend and with heroic patience years on years deepsearching saw at last the system dawn and shine of all his race on him alone   what were his raptures then how pure how strong and what the triumphs of old greece and rome by his diminishd but the pride of boys in some small fray victorious when instead of shatterd parcels of this earth usurpd by violence unmanly and sore deeds of cruelty and blood nature herself stood all subdud by him and open laid her every latent glory to his view   all intellectual eye our solarround first gazing through he by the blended power of gravitation and projection saw the whole in silent harmony revolve from unassisted vision hid the moons to cheer remoter planets numerous pourd by him in all their mingled tracts were seen he also fixd the wandering queen of night whether she wanes into a scanty orb or waxing broad with her pale shadowy light in a soft deluge overflows the sky her every motion cleardiscerning he adjusted to the mutual main and taught why now the mighty mass of water swells resistless heaving on the broken rocks and the full river turning till again the tide revertive unattracted leaves a yellow waste of idle sands behind   then breaking hence he took his ardent flight through the blue infinite and every star which the clear concave of a winters night pours on the eye or astronomic tube farstretching snatches from the dark abyss or such as farther in successive skies to fancy shine alone at his approach blazd into suns the living centre each of an harmonious system all combind and ruld unerring by that single power which draws the stone projected to the ground   o unprofuse magnificence divine o wisdom truly perfect thus to call from a few causes such a scheme of things effects so various beautiful and great an universe complete and o belovd of heaven whose wellpurgd penetrative eye the mystic veil transpiercing inly scannd the rising moving wideestablishd frame   he first of men with awful wing pursud the comet through the long elliptic curve as round innumerous worlds he wound his way till to the forehead of our evening sky returnd the blazing wonder glares anew and oer the trembling nations shakes dismay   the heavens are all his own from the wild rule of whirling vortices and circling spheres to their first great simplicity restord the schools astonishd stood but found it vain to keep at odds with demonstration strong and unawakend dream beneath the blaze of truth at once their pleasing visions fled with the gay shadows of the morning mixd when newton rose our philosophic sun th arial flow of sound was known to him from whence it first in wavy circles breaks till the touchd organ takes the message in nor could the darting beam of speed immense escape his swift pursuit and measuring eye evn light itself which every thing displays shone undiscoverd till his brighter mind untwisted all the shining robe of day and from the whitening undistinguishd blaze collecting every ray into his kind to the charmd eye educd the gorgeous train of parent colours first the flaming red sprung vivid forth the tawny orange next and next delicious yellow by whose side fell the kind beams of allrefreshing green then the pure blue that swells autumnal skies ethereal played and then of sadder hue emergd the deepend indigo as when the heavyskirted evening droops with frost while the last gleamings of refracted light died in the fainting violet away these when the clouds distil the rosy shower shine out distinct adown the watry bow while oer our heads the dewy vision bends delightful melting on the fields beneath myriads of mingling dyes from these result and myriads still remaininfinite source of beauty ever flushing ever new   did ever poet image aught so fair dreaming in whispring groves by the hoarse brook or prophet to whose rapture heaven descends evn now the setting sun and shifting clouds seen greenwich from thy lovely heights declare how just how beauteous the refractive law   the noiseless tide of time all bearing down to vast eternitys unbounded sea where the green islands of the happy shine he stemmd alone and to the source involvd deep in primeval gloom ascending raisd his lights at equal distances to guide historian wilderd on his darksome way   but who can number up his labours who his high discoveries sing when but a few of the deepstudying race can stretch their minds to what he knewin fancys lighter thought how shall the muse then grasp the mighty theme   what wonder thence that his devotion swelld responsive to his knowledge for could he whose piercing mental eye diffusive saw the finishd university of things in all its order magnitude and parts forbear incessant to adore that power who fills sustains and actuates the whole   say ye who best can tell ye happy few who saw him in the softest lights of life all unwithheld indulging to his friends the vast unborrowd treasures of his mind oh speak the wondrous man how mild how calr how greatly humble how divinely good how firm establishd on eternal truth fervent in doing well with every nerve still pressing on forgetful of the past and panting for perfection far above those little cares and visionary joys that so perplex the fond impassiond heart of evercheated evertrusting man this conduitt from thy rural hours we hope as through the pleasing shade where nature pours her every sweet in studious ease you walk the social passions smiling at thy heart that glows with all the recollected sage   and you ye hopeless gloomyminded tribe you who unconscious of those nobler flights that reach impatient at immortal life against the prime endearing privilege of being dare contendsay can a soul of such extensive deep tremendous powers enlarging still be but a finer breath of spirits dancing through their tubes awhile and then for ever lost in vacant air   but hark methinks i hear a warning voice solemn as when some awful change is come sound through the world tis donethe measures full and i resign my chargeye mouldering stones that build the towering pyramid the proud triumphal arch the monument effacd by ruthless ruin and whateer supports the worshipd name of hoar antiquity down to the dust what grandeur can ye boast while newton lifts his column to the skies beyond the waste of time let no weak drop be shed for him the virgin in her bloom cut off the joyous youth and darling child these are the tombs that claim the tender tear and elegiac song but newton calls for other notes of gratulation high that now he wanders through those endless worlds he here so well descried and wondering talks and hymns their author with his glad compeers   o britains boast whether with angels thou sittest in dread discourse or fellowblest who joy to see the honour of their kind or whether mounted on cherubic wing thy swift career is with the whirling orbs comparing things with things in rapture lost and grateful adoration for that light so plenteous rayd into thy mind below from light himself oh look with pity down on humankind a frail erroneous race exalt the spirit of a downward world oer thy dejected country chief preside and be her genius calld her studies raise correct her manners and inspire her youth for though depravd and sunk she brought thee forth and glories in thy name she points thee out to all her sons and bids them eye thy star while in expectance of the second life when time shall be no more thy sacred dust sleeps with her kings and dignifies the scene ,10,1700,1748,1
1,1,James Thomson,see winter comes to rule the varied year  sullen and sad with all his rising train vapours and clouds and storms be these my theme these that exalt the soul to solemn thought and heavenly musing welcome kindred glooms  wishd wintry horrors hail  with frequent foot pleasd have i in my cheerful morn of life when nursd by careless solitude i livd and sung of nature with unceasing joy pleasd have i wanderd thro your rough domains  trod the pure virgin snows my self as pure heard the winds roar and the big torrent burst or seen the deep fermenting tempest brewd in the red evening sky  thus passd the time till thro the opening chambers of the south  lookd out the joyous spring lookd out and smild thee too inspirer of the toiling swain fair autumn yellow robd ill sing of thee of thy last temperd days and sunny calms when all the golden hours are on the wing  attending thy retreat and round thy wain slowrolling onward to the southern sky  behold the wellpoisd hornet hovering hangs with quivering pinions in the genial blaze flys off in airy circles then returns  and hums and dances to the beating ray nor shall the man that musing walks alone and heedless strays within his radiant lists go unchastisd away  sometimes a fleece of clouds widescattering with a lucid veil  soft shadow oer thunruffled face of heaven and thro their dewy sluices shed the sun with temperd influence down then is the time for those whom wisdom and whom nature charm to steal themselves from the degenerate croud  and soar above this little scene of things to tread lowthoughted vice beneath their feet to lay their passions in a gentle calm and woo lone quiet in her silent walks  now solitary and in pensive guise  oft let me wander oer the russet mead or thro the pining grove where scarce is heard one dying strain to chear the woodmans toil sad philomel perchance pours forth her plaint far thro the withering copse mean while the leaves  that late the forest clad with lively green nipt by the drizzly night and sallowhud fall wavering thro the air or shower amain urgd by the breeze that sobs amid the boughs then listning hares forsake the rusling woods  and starting at the frequent noise escape to the rough stubble and the rushy fen then woodcocks oer the fluctuating main that glimmers to the glimpses of the moon stretch their long voyage to the woodland glade  where wheeling with uncertain flight they mock the nimble fowlers aim  now nature droops languish the living herbs with pale decay and all the various family of flowers their sunny robes resign the falling fruits  thro the still night forsake the parentbough that in the first grey glances of the dawn looks wild and wonders at the wintry waste  the year yet pleasing but declining fast soft oer the secret soul in gentle gales  a philosophic melancholly breathes and bears the swelling thought aloft to heaven then forming fancy rouses to conceive what never mingled with the vulgars dream then wake the tender pang the pitying tear  the sigh for suffering worth the wish preferd for humankind the joy to see them blessd and all the social offspring of the heart  oh bear me then to high embowering shades to twilight groves and visionary vales  to weeping grottos and to hoary caves where angelforms are seen and voices heard sighd in low whispers that abstract the soul from outward sense far into worlds remote  now when the western sun withdraws the day  and humid evening gliding oer the sky in her chill progress checks the straggling beams and robs them of their gatherd vapoury prey where marshes stagnate and where rivers wind cluster the rolling fogs and swim along  the duskymantled lawn then slow descend once more to mingle with their watry friends the vivid stars shine out in radiant files and boundless ether glows till the fair moon shows her broad visage in the crimsond east  now stooping seems to kiss the passing cloud now oer the pure cerulean rides sublime wide the pale deluge floats with silver waves oer the skyd mountain to the lowlaid vale from the white rocks with dim reflexion gleams  and faintly glitters thro the waving shades  all night abundant dews unnoted fall and at return of morning silver oer the face of motherearth from every branch depending tremble the translucent gems  and quivering seem to fall away yet cling and sparkle in the sun whose rising eye with fogs bedimd portends a beauteous day  now giddy youth whom headlong passions fire rouse the wild game and stain the guiltless grove  with violence and death yet call it sport to scatter ruin thro the realms of love and peace that thinks no ill but these the muse whose charity unlimited extends as wide as nature works disdains to sing  returning to her nobler theme in view   for see where winter comes himself confest striding the gloomy blast first rains obscure drive thro the mingling skies with tempest foul beat on the mountains brow and shake the woods  that sounding wave below the dreary plain lies overwhelmd and lost the bellying clouds combine and deepening into night shut up the days fair face the wanderers of heaven each to his home retire save those that love  to take their pastime in the troubled air and skimming flutter round the dimply flood the cattle from thuntasted fields return and ask with meaning low their wonted stalls or ruminate in the contiguous shade  thither the houshold feathery people croud the crested cock with all his female train pensive and wet mean while the cottageswain hangs oer thenlivening blaze and taleful there recounts his simple frolic much he talks  and much he laughs nor recks the storm that blows without and rattles on his humble roof  at last the muddy deluge pours along resistless roaring dreadful down it comes from the chapt mountain and the mossy wild  tumbling thro rocks abrupt and sounding far then oer the sanded valley floating spreads calm sluggish silent till again constraind betwixt two meeting hills it bursts a way where rocks and woods oerhang the turbid stream  there gathering triple force rapid and deep it boils and wheels and foams and thunders thro  nature great parent whose directing hand rolls round the seasons of the changeful year how mighty how majestick are thy works  with what a pleasing dread they swell the soul that sees astonishd and astonishd sings you too ye winds that now begin to blow with boisterous sweep i raise my voice to you where are your stores ye viewless beings say  where your aerial magazines reservd against the day of tempest perilous in what untraveld country of the air hushd in still silence sleep you when tis calm  late in the louring sky red fiery streaks  begin to flush about the reeling clouds stagger with dizzy aim as doubting yet which master to obey while rising slow sad in the leadencolourd east the moon wears a bleak circle round her sullyd orb  then issues forth the storm with loud control and the thin fabrick of the pillard air oerturns at once prone on thuncertain main descends thetherial force and plows its waves with dreadful rift from the middeep appears  surge after surge the rising watry war whitening the angry billows rowl immense and roar their terrors thro the shuddering soul of feeble man amidst their fury caught and dashd upon his fate then oer the cliff  where dwells the seamew unconfind they fly and hurrying swallow up the steril shore  the mountain growls and all its sturdy sons stoop to the bottom of the rocks they shade lone on its midnightside and all aghast  the dark wayfaring stranger breathless toils and climbs against the blast  low waves the rooted forest vexd and sheds what of its leafy honours yet remains thus struggling thro the dissipated grove  the whirling tempest raves along the plain and on the cottage thacht or lordly dome keenfastening shakes em to the solid base sleep frighted flies the hollow chimney howls the windows rattle and the hinges creak   then too they say thro all the burthend air long groans are heard shrill sounds and distant sighs that murmurd by the demon of the night warn the devoted wretch of woe and death wild uproar lords it wide the clouds commixt  with stars swiftgliding sweep along the sky all nature reels  but hark the almighty speaks instant the chidden storm begins to pant and dies at once into a noiseless calm  as yet tis midnights reign the weary clouds  slowmeeting mingle into solid gloom now while the drousy world lies lost in sleep let me associate with the lowbrowd night and contemplation her sedate compeer let me shake off thintrusive cares of day and lay the medling senses all aside  and now ye lying vanities of life you evertempting evercheating train where are you now and what is your amount vexation disappointment and remorse  sad sickening thought and yet deluded man a scene of wild disjointed visions past and broken slumbers rises still resolvd with newflushd hopes to run your giddy round  father of light and life thou good supreme  o teach me what is good teach me thy self save me from folly vanity and vice from every low pursuit and feed my soul with knowledge conscious peace and vertue pure sacred substantial neverfading bliss   lo from the livid east or piercing north thick clouds ascend in whose capacious womb a vapoury deluge lies to snow congeald heavy they roll their fleecy world along and the sky saddens with thimpending storm  thro the hushd air the whitening shower descends at first thinwavering till at last the flakes fall broad and wide and fast dimming the

seeks urgd on by fearless want the bleating kind eye the bleak heavens and next the glistening earth with looks of dumb despair then sad dispersd dig for the witherd herb thro heaps of snow  now shepherds to your helpless charge be kind baffle the raging year and fill their penns with food at will lodge them below the blast and watch them strict for from the bellowing east in this dire season oft the whirlwinds wing sweeps up the burthen of whole wintry plains in one fierce blast and oer thunhappy flocks lodgd in the hollow of two neighbouring hills the billowy tempest whelms till upwards

bickering stream the nightly sky and all her glowing constellations pour their rigid influence down it freezes on till morn laterising oer the drooping world lifts her pale eye unjoyous then appears the various labour of the silent night the pendant isicle the frostwork fair where thousand figures rise the crusted snow tho white made whiter by the fining north on blithsome frolics bent the

59,59,Anne Kingsmill Finch,now spent the alterd king in amrous cares  the hours of sacred hymns and solemn prayrs  in vain the alter waits his slow returns  where unattended incense faintly burns  in vain the whispring priests their fears express  and of the change a thousand causes guess  heedless of all their censures he retires  and in his palace feeds his secret fires  impatient till from rabbah tydings tell  that near those walls the poor uriah fell  led to the onset by a chosen few  who at the treacherous signal soon withdrew  nor to his rescue eer returnd again  till by fierce ammons sword they saw the victim slain  tis passd tis done the holy marriageknot  too strong to be untyd at last is cut  and now to bathsheba the king declares  that with his heart the kingdom too is hers  that israels throne and longing monarchs arms  are to be filld but with her widowd charms  nor must the days of formal tears exceed  to cross the living and abuse the dead  this she denies and signs of grief are worn  but mourns no more than may her face adorn  give to those eyes which love and empire fird  a melting softness more to be desird  till the fixt time tho hard to be endurd  was passd and a sad consorts name procurd  when with the pomp that suits a princes thought  by passion swayd and glorious woman taught  a queen shes made than michal seated higher  whilst light unusual airs prophane the hallowd lyre   where art thou nathan wheres that spirit now  givn to brave vice tho on a princes brow  in what low cave or on what desert coast  now virtue wants it is thy presence lost    but lo he comes the revrend bard appears  defild with dust his awful silver hairs  and his rough garment wet with falling tears  the king this markd and conscious woud have fled  the healing balm which for his wounds was shed  till the more wary priest the serpents art  joind to the dovelike temper of his heart  and thus retards the prince just ready now to part    hear me the cause betwixt two neighbors hear  thou who for justice dost the sceptre bear  help the opprest nor let me weep alone  for him that calls for succour from the throne  good princes for protection are adord  and greater by the shield than by the sword  this clears the doubt and now no more he fears  the cause his own and therefore stays and hears  when thus the prophet   in a flowry plain  a kinglike man does in full plenty reign  casts round his eyes in vain to reach the bound  which jordans flood sets to his fertile ground  countless his flocks whilst lebanon contains  a herd as large kept by his numerous swains  that fill with morning bellowings the cool air  and to the cedars shade at scorching noon repair  near to this wood a lowly cottage stands  built by the humble owners painful hands  fencd by a stubbleroof from rain and heat  securd without within all plain and neat  a field of small extent surrounds the place  in which one single ewe did sport and graze  this his whole stock till in full time there came  to bless his utmost hopes a snowy lamb  which lest the season yet too cold might prove  and northern blasts annoy it from the grove  or towring fowl on the weak prey might sieze  for with his store his fears must too increase  he brings it home and lays it by his side  at once his wealth his pleasure and his pride  still bars the door by labour calld away  and when returning at the close of day  with one small mess himself and that sustains  and half his dish it shares and half his slender gains  when to the great mans table now there comes  a lord as great followd by hungry grooms   for these must be provided sundry meats  the best for some for others coarser cates  one servant diligent above the rest  to help his master to contrive the feast  extols the lamb was nourished with such care  so fed so lodgd it must be princely fare  and having this my lord his own may spare  in haste he sends led by no law but will  not to entreat or purchase but to

his goodness and thy fault  to lead thee back to those forgotten years  in labour spent and lowly rustick cares  when in the wilderness thy flocks but few  thou didst the shepherds simple art pursue  thro crusting frosts and penetrating dew  till wondring jesse saw six brothers past  and thou elected thou the least and last  a sceptre to thy rural hand conveyd  and in thy bosom royal beauties laid  a lovely princess made thy prize that day  when on the shaken ground the giant lay  stupid in death beyond the reach of cries  that bore thy shouted fame to listning skies  and drove the flying foe as fast away  as winds of old locusts to egypts sea  thy heart with love thy temples with renown  th allgiving hand of heavn did largely crown  whilst yet thy cheek was spread with youthful down  what more coud craving man of god implore  or what for favourd man coud god do more  yet coud not these nor israels throne suffice  intemprate wishes drawn thro wandring eyes   one beauty not thy own and seen by chance  melts down the work of grace with an alluring glance  chafes the spirit fed by sacred art  and blots the title after gods own heart  black murder breeds to level at his head  who boasts so fair a partner of his bed  nor longer must possess those envyd charms  the single treasure of his house and arms  giving by this thy fall cause to blaspheme  to all the heathen the almighty name  for which the sword shall still thy race pursue  and in revolted israels scornful view  thy captivd wives shall be in triumph led  unto a bold usurpers shameful bed  who from thy bowels sprung shall seize thy throne  and scourge thee by a sin beyond thy own  thou hast thy fault in secret darkness done  but this the world shall see before the noondays sun    enough the king enough the saint replies  and pours his swift repentance from his eyes  falls on the ground and tears the nuptial vest  by which his crimes completion was exprest  then with a sigh blasting to carnal love  drawn deep

despair  the wound that is thus willingly reveald  th almighty is as willing should be heald  thus washd in tears thy soul as fair does show  as the first fleece which on the lamb does grow  or on the mountains top the lately fallen snow   yet to the world that justice may appear  acting her part impartial and severe  the offspring of thy sin shall soon resign  that life for which thou must not once repine  but with submissive grief his fate deplore  and bless the hand that does inflict no more   shall i then pay but part and owe the whole  my bodys fruit for my offending soul  shall i no more endure the king demands  and scape thus lightly his offended hands  oh let him all resume my crown my fame  reduce me to the nothing whence i came  call back his favours faster than he gave  and if but pardond strip me to my grave    since tho he seems to lose  he surely wins  who gives but earthly comforts for his sins ,67,1661,1720,1

oer thee the least command  thou by their motions too mightst understand     amintor being askd by thirsis  who is the object of his love  speaks as follows  amint thirsis to thee i mean that name to show  which only yet our groves and fountains know  that when my death shall through the plains be told  thou with the wretched cause mayst that unfold  to everyone who shall my story find  carvd by thy hand in some fair beeches rind  beneath whose shade the bleeding body lay  that when by chance she shall be led that way  oer my sad grave the haughty nymph may go  and the proud triumph of her beauty shew  to all the swains to strangers as they pass  and yet at length she may but oh alas  i fear too high my flattring hopes do soar  yet she at length may my sad fate deplore  may weep me dead may oer my tomb recline  and sighing wish were he alive and mine  but mark me to the end thir go on for well i do thy speech attend  perhaps to better ends than yet thou knowst  amint being now a child or but a youth at most  when scarce to reach the blushing fruit i knew  which on the lowest bending branches grew  still with the dearest sweetest kindest maid  young as myself at childish sports i playd  the fairest sure of all that lovely kind  who spread their golden tresses to the wind  cydippes daughter and montanos heir  whose flocks and herds so numrous do appear  the beauteous sylvia she tis she i love  warmth of all hearts and pride of evry grove  with her i livd no turtles eer so fond  our houses met but more our souls were joind  together nets for fish and fowl we laid  together through the spacious forest strayd  pursud with equal speed the flying deer  and of the spoils there no divisions were  but whilst i from the beasts their freedom won  alas i know not how my own was gone  by unperceivd degrees the fire encreasd  which filld at last each corner of my breast  as from a root tho scarce discernd so small  a plant may rise that grows amazing tall  from sylvias presence now i could not move  and from her eyes took in full draughts of love  which sweetly thro my ravishd mind distilld  yet in the end such bitterness woud yield  that oft i sighd ere yet i knew the cause  and was a lover ere i dreamd i was  but oh at last too well my state i knew  and now will shew thee how this passion grew  then listen while the pleasing tale i tell     thirsis persuades amintor not to despair upon the  redictions of mopsus discovring him to be an impostor  thirsis why dost thou still give way to such despair  amintor too just alas the weighty causes are  mopsus wise mopsus who in art excels  and of all plants the secret vertue tells  knows with what healing gifts our springs abound  and of each bird explains the mystick sound  twas he evn he my wretched fate foretold  thir dost thou this speech then of that mopsus hold  who whilst his smiles attract the easy view  drops flattring words soft as the falling dew  whose outward form all friendly still appears  tho fraud and daggers in his thoughts he wears  and the unwary labours to surprize  with looks affected and with riddling lyes  if he it is that bids thy love despair  i hope the happier end of all thy care  so far from truth his vain predictions fall  amint if ought thou knowst that may my hopes recall  conceal it not for great ive heard his fame  and feard his words thir when hither first i came  and in these shades the false imposter met  like thee i prizd and thought his judgment great  on all his studyd speeches still relyd  nor feard to err whilst led by such a guide  when on a day that busness and delight  my steps did to the neighbring town invite  which stands upon that rising mountains side  and from our plains this river dos divide  he checkd me thusbe warnd in time my son  and that new world of painted mischiefs shun  whose gay inhabitants thou shalt behold  plumd like our birds and sparkling all in gold  courtiers that will thy rustick garb despise  and mock thy plainness with disdainful eyes  but above all that structure see thou fly  where hoarded vanities and witchcrafts lie  to shun that path be thy peculiar care  i ask what of that place the dangers are  to which he soon replies there shalt thou meet  of soft enchantresses th enchantments sweet  who subtly will thy solid sense bereave  and a false gloss to evry object give  brass to thy sight as polishd gold shall seem  and glass thou as the diamond shalt esteem   huge heaps of silver to thee shall appear  which if approachd will prove but shining air  the very walls by magick art are wrought  and repitition to all speakers taught  not such as from our ecchoes we obtain  which only our last words return again  but speech for speech entirely there they give  and often add beyond what they receive  there downy couches to false rest invite  the lawn is charmd that faintly bars the light  no gilded seat no ivry board is there  but what thou mayst for some delusion fear  whilst farther to abuse thy wondring eyes  strange antick shapes before them shall arise  fantastick fiends that will about thee flock  and all they see with imitation mock  nor are these ills the worst thyself mayst be  transformd into a flame a stream a tree  a tear congeald by art thou mayst remain  till by a burning sigh dissolvd again   thus spake the wretch but coud not shake my mind  my way i take and soon the city find  where above all that lofty fabrick stands  which with one view the town and plains commands  here was i stopt for who coud quit the ground  that heard such musick from those roofs resound  musick beyond th enticing syrenes note  musick beyond the swans expiring throat  beyond the softest voice that charms the grove  and equald only by the spheres above  my ear i thought too narrow for the art  nor fast enough conveyd it to my heart  when in the entrance of the gate i saw  a man majestick and commanding awe  yet temperd with a carriage so refind  that undetermind was my doubtful mind  whether for love or war that form was most designd   with such a brow as did at once declare  a gentle nature and a wit severe  to view that palace me he askd to go  tho royal he and i obscure and low  but the delights my senses there did meet  no rural tongue no swain can eer repeat  celestial goddesses or nymphs as fair  in unveild beauties to all eyes appear  sprinkld with gold as glorious to the view  as young aurora deckd with pearly dew  bright rays dispensing as along they passd  and with new light the shining palace gracd  phoebus was there by all the muses met  and at his feet was our elpino set  evn humble me their harmony inspird  my breast expanded and my spirits fird  rude pastral now no longer i rehearse  but heroes crown with my exalted verse  of arms i sung of bold adventrous wars  and tho brought back by my too envious stars  yet kept my voice and reed those lofty strains  and sent loud musick through the wondring plains  which mopsus hearing secretly malignd  and now to ruin both at once designd  which by his sorceries he soon brought to pass  and suddenly so cloggd and hoarse i was  that all our shepherds at the change amazd  believd i on some evningwolf had gazd  when he it was my luckless path had crost  by whose dire look my skill awhile was lost  this have i told to raise thy hopes again  and render by distrust his malice vain     from the aminta of tasso  tho we of small proportion see  and slight the armed golden bee  yet if her sting behind she leaves  no ease th envenomd flesh receives  love less to sight than is this fly  in a soft curl conceald can lie  under an eyelids lovely shade  can form a dreadful ambuscade  can the most subtil sight beguile  hid in the dimples of a smile  but if from thence a dart he throw  how sure how mortal is the blow  how helpless all the powr of art  to bind or to restore the heart     from the aminta of tasso   part of the description of the golden age then by some fountains flowry side  the loves unarmd did still abide  then the loosd quiver careless hung  the torch extinct the bow unstrung  then by the nymphs no charms were worn  but such as with the nymphs were born  the shepherd coud not then complain  nor told his amrous tale in vain  no veil the beauteous face did hide  nor harmless freedom was denyd  then innocence and virtue reignd  pure unaffected unconstraind  love was their pleasure and their praise  the soft employment of their days,67,1661,1720,1

549,549,Isaac Watts,christs sufferings and exaltation  now let our mournful songs record the dying sorrows of our lord when he complained in tears and blood as one forsaken of his god  the jews beheld him thus forlorn and shake their heads and laugh in scorn he rescued others from the grave now let him try himself to save  this is the man did once pretend god was his father and his friend if god the blessed loved him so why doth he fail to help him now  barbarous people cruel priests how they stood round like savage beasts like lions gaping to devour when god had left him in their power  they wound his head his hands his feet till streams of blood each other meet by lot his garments they divide and mock the pangs in which he died  but god his father heard his cry raised from the dead he reigns on high the nations learn his righteousness and humble sinners taste his grace,458,1674,1748,1

591,591,Phillis Wheatley,samuel chap xvii  ye martial powrs and all ye tuneful nine inspire my song and aid my high design the dreadful scenes and toils of war i write the ardent warriors and the fields of fight you best remember and you best can sing the acts of heroes to the vocal string resume the lays with which your sacred lyre did then the poet and the sage inspire now front to front the armies were displayd here israel rangd and there the foes arrayd the hosts on two opposing mountains stood thick as the foliage of the waving wood between them an extensive valley lay oer which the gleaming armour pourd the day when from the camp of the philistine foes dreadful to view a mighty warrior rose in the dire deeds of bleeding battle skilld the monster stalks the terror of the field from gath he sprung goliath was his name of fierce deportment and gigantic frame a brazen helmet on his head was placd a coat of mail his form terrific gracd the greaves his legs the targe his shoulders prest dreadful in arms hightowring oer the rest a spear he proudly wavd whose iron head strange to relate six hundred shekels weighd he strode along and shook the ample field while phoebus blazd refulgent on his shield through jacobs race a chilling horror ran when thus the huge enormous chief began say what the cause that in this proud array you set your battle in the face of day one hero find in all your vaunting train then see who loses and who wins the plain for he who wins in triumph may demand perpetual service from the vanquishd land your armies i defy your force despise by far inferior in philistias eyes produce a man and let us try the fight decide the contest and the victors right thus challengd he all israel stood amazd and evry chief in consternation gazd but jesses son in youthful bloom appears and warlike courage far beyond his years he left the folds he left the flowry meads and soft recesses of the sylvan shades now israels monarch and his troops arise with peals of shouts ascending to the skies in elahs vale the scene of combat lies when the fair morning blushd with orient red what davids fire enjoind the son obeyd and swift of foot towards the trench he came where glowd each bosom with the martial flame he leaves his carriage to anothers care and runs to greet his brethren of the war while yet they spake the giantchief arose repeats the challenge and insults his foes struck with the sound and trembling at the view affrighted israel from its post withdrew observe ye this tremendous foe they cryd who in proud vaunts our armies hath defyd whoever lays him prostrate on the plain freedom in israel for his house shall gain and on him wealth unknown the king will pour and give his royal daughter for his dowr then jesses youngest hope my brethren say what shall be done for him who takes away reproach from jacob who destroys the chief and puts a period to his countrys grief he vaunts the honours of his arms abroad and scorns the armies of the living god thus spoke the youth th attentive people eyd the wondrous hero and again replyd such the rewards our monarch will bestow on him who conquers and destroys his foe eliab heard and kindled into ire to hear his shepherd brother thus inquire and thus begun what errand brought thee say who keeps thy flock or does it go astray i know the base ambition of thine heart but back in safety from the field depart eliab thus to jesses youngest heir expressd his wrath in accents most severe when to his brother mildly he replyd what have i done or what the cause to chide the words were told before the king who sent for the young hero to his royal tent before the monarch dauntless he began for this philistine fail no heart of man ill take the vale and with the giant fight i dread not all his boasts nor all his might when thus the king darst thou a stripling go and venture combat with so great a foe who all his days has been inurd to fight and made its deeds his study and delight battles and bloodshed brought the monster forth and clouds and whirlwinds usherd in his birth when david thus i kept the fleecy care and out there rushd a lion and a bear a tender lamb the hungry lion took and with no other weapon than my crook bold i pursud and chas d him oer the field the prey deliverd and the felon killd as thus the lion and the bear i slew so shall goliath fall and all his crew the god who savd me from these beasts of prey by me this monster in the dust shall lay so david spoke the wondring king replyd go thou with heavn and victory on thy side this coat of mail this sword gird on he said and placd a mighty helmet on his head the coat the sword the helm he laid aside nor chose to venture with those arms untryd then took his staff and to the neighbring brook instant he ran and thence five pebbles took mean time descended to philistias son a radiant cherub and he thus begun goliath well thou knowst thou hast defyd yon hebrew armies and their god denyd rebellious wretch audacious worm forbear nor tempt the vengeance of their god too far them who with his omnipotence contend no eye shall pity and no arm defend proud as thou art in short livd glory great i come to tell thee thine approaching fate regard my words the judge of all the gods beneath whose steps the towring mountain nods will give thine armies to the savage brood that cut the liquid air or range the wood thee too a wellaimd pebble shall destroy and thou shalt perish by a beardless boy such is the mandate from the realms above and should i try the vengeance to remove myself a rebel to my king would prove goliath say shall grace to him be shown who dares heavns monarch and insults his throne your words are lost on me the giant cries while fear and wrath contended in his eyes when thus the messenger from heavn replies provoke no more jehovahs awful hand to hurl its vengeance on thy guilty land he grasps the thunder and he wings the storm servants their sovreigns orders to perform the angel spoke and turnd his eyes away adding new radiance to the rising day now david comes the fatal stones demand his left the staff engagd his better hand the giant movd and from his towring height surveyd the stripling and disdaind the fight and thus began am i a dog with thee bringst thou no armour but a staff to me the gods on thee their vollied curses pour and beasts and birds of prey thy flesh devour david undaunted thus thy spear and shield shall no protection to thy body yield jehovahs nameno other arms i bear i ask no other in this glorious war today the lord of hosts to me will give victry today thy doom thou shalt receive the fate you threaten shall your own become and beasts shall be your animated tomb that all the earths inhabitants may know that theres a god who governs all below this great assembly too shall witness stand that needs nor sword nor spear th almightys hand the battle his the conquest he bestows and to our powr consigns our hated foes thus david spoke goliath heard and came to meet the hero in the field of fame ah fatal meeting to thy troops and thee but thou wast deaf to the divine decree young david meets thee meets thee not in vain tis thine to perish on th ensanguind plain and now the youth the forceful pebble slung philistia trembled as it whizzd along in his dread forehead where the helmet ends just oer the brows the wellaimd stone descends it piercd the skull and shatterd all the brain prone on his face he tumbled to the plain goliaths fall no smaller terror yields than riving thunders in aerial fields the soul still lingred in its lovd abode till conqring david oer the giant strode goliaths sword then laid its master dead and from the body hewd the ghastly head the blood in gushing torrents drenchd the plains the soul found passage through the spouting veins and now aloud th illustrious victor said where are your boastings now your champions dead scarce had he spoke when the philistines fled but fled in vain the conquror swift pursud what scenes of slaughter and what seas of blood there saul thy thousands graspd th impurpled sand in pangs of death the conquest of thine hand and david there were thy ten thousands laid thus israels damsels musically playd near gath and edron many an hero lay breathd out their souls and cursd the light of day their fury quenchd by death no longer burns and david with goliaths head returns to salem brought but in his tent he placd the load of armour which the giant gracd his monarch saw him coming from the war and thus demanded of the son of ner say who is this amazing youth he cryd when thus the leader of the host replyd as lives thy soul i know not whence he sprung so great in prowess though in years so young inquire whose son is he the sovreign said before whose conqring arm philistia fled before the king behold the stripling stand goliaths head depending from his hand to him the king say of what martial line art thou young hero and what sire was thine he humbly thus the son of jesse i i came the glories of the field to try small is my tribe but valiant in the fight small is my city but thy royal right then take the promisd gifts the monarch cryd conferring riches and the royal bride knit to my soul for ever thou remain with me nor quit my regal roof again ,41,1753,1784,1

627,627,Thomas Gray,the curfew tolls the knell of parting day the lowing herd wind slowly oer the lea the ploughman homeward plods his weary way and leaves the world to darkness and to me  now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight and all the air a solemn stillness holds save where the beetle wheels his droning flight and drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds  save that from yonder ivymantled tower the moping owl does to the moon complain of such as wandering near her secret bower molest her ancient solitary reign  beneath those rugged elms that yewtrees shade where heaves the turf in many a mouldring heap each in his narrow cell for ever laid the rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep  the breezy call of incensebreathing morn the swallow twittering from the strawbuilt shed the cocks shrill clarion or the echoing horn no more shall rouse them from their lowly bed  for them no more the blazing hearth shall burn or busy housewife ply her eveningcare no children run to lisp their sires return or climb his knees the envied kiss to share  oft did the harvest to their sickle yield their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke how jocund did they drive their team afield how bowed the woods beneath their sturdy stroke  let not ambition mock their useful toil their homely joys and destiny obscure nor grandeur hear with a disdainful smile the short and simple annals of the poor  the boast of heraldry the pomp of powr and all that beauty all that wealth eer gave awaits alike th inevitable hour the paths of glory lead but to the grave  nor you ye proud impute to these the fault if memory oer their tomb no trophies raise where through the longdrawn aisle and fretted vault the pealing anthem swells the note of praise  can storied urn or animated bust back to its mansion call the fleeting breath can honours voice provoke the silent dust or flattery soothe the dull cold ear of death  perhaps in this neglected spot is laid some heart once pregnant with celestial fire hands that the rod of empire might have swayed or waked to ecstasy the living lyre  but knowledge to their eyes her ample page rich with the spoils of time did neer unroll chill penury repressed their noble rage and froze the genial current of the soul  full many a gem of purest ray serene the dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear full many a flower is born to blush unseen and waste its sweetness on the desert air  some villagehampden that with dauntless breast the little tyrant of his fields withstood some mute inglorious milton here may rest some cromwell guiltless of his countrys blood  th applause of listning senates to command the threats of pain and ruin to despise to scatter plenty oer a smiling land and read their history in a nations eyes  their lot forbad nor circumscribed alone their growing virtues but their crimes confined forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne and shut the gates of mercy on mankind  the struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide to quench the blushes of ingenuous shame or heap the shrine of luxury and pride with incense kindled at the muses flame  far from the madding crowds ignoble strife their sober wishes never learned to stray along the cool sequestered vale of life they kept the noiseless tenor of their way  yet evn these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture decked implores the passing tribute of a sigh  their name their years spelt by th unlettered muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die  for who to dumb forgetfulness a prey this pleasing anxious being eer resigned left the warm precincts of the cheerful day nor cast one longing lingring look behind  on some fond breast the parting soul relies some pious drops the closing eye requires evn from the tomb the voice of nature cries evn in our ashes live their wonted fires  for thee who mindful of th unhonoured dead dost in these lines their artless tale relate if chance by lonely contemplation led some kindred spirit shall enquire thy fate   haply some hoaryheaded swain may say oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn brushing with hasty steps the dews away to meet the sun upon the upland lawn  there at the foot of yonder nodding beech that wreathes its old fantastic roots so high his listless length at noontide would he stretch and pore upon the brook that babbles by  hard by yon wood now smiling as in scorn muttring his wayward fancies would he rove now drooping woefulwan like one forlorn or crazed with care or crossed in hopeless love  one morn i missed him from the customed hill along the heath and near his favrite tree another came nor yet beside the rill nor up the lawn nor at the wood was he  the next with dirges due in sad array slow through the churchway path we saw him borne  approach and read for thou canst read the lay graved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn  the epitaph  here rests his head upon the lap of earth a youth to fortune and to fame unknown fair science frowned not on his humble birth and melancholy marked him for her own  large was his bounty and his soul sincere heaven did a recompense as largely send he gave to misery all he had a tear he gained from heaven twas all he wished a friend  no farther seek his merits to disclose or draw his frailties from their dread abode there they alike in trembling hope repose the bosom of his father and his god,11,1716,1771,1

636,636,Jonathan Swift,as rochefoucauld his maxims drew from nature i believe em true they argue no corrupted mind in him the fault is in mankind  this maxim more than all the rest is thought too base for human breast in all distresses of our friends we first consult our private ends while nature kindly bent to ease us points out some circumstance to please us  if this perhaps your patience move let reason and experience prove we all behold with envious eyes our equal raised above our size who would not at a crowded show stand high himself keep others low i love my friend as well as you but why should he obstruct my view then let me have the higher post suppose it but an inch at most if in battle you should find one whom you love of all mankind had some heroic action done a champion killed or trophy won rather than thus be overtopped would you not wish his laurels cropped dear honest ned is in the gout lies racked with pain and you without how patiently you hear him groan how glad the case is not your own  what poet would not grieve to see his brethren write as well as he but rather than they should excel he wished his rivals all in hell  her end when emulation misses she turns to envy stings and hisses the strongest friendship yields to pride unless the odds be on our side vain human kind fantastic race thy various follies who can trace selflove ambition envy pride their empire in our hearts divide give others riches power and station tis all on me an usurpation i have no title to aspire yet when you sink i seem the higher in pope i cannot read a line but with a sigh i wish it mine when he can in one couplet fix more sense than i can do in six it gives me such a jealous fit i cry pox take him and his wit i grieve to be outdone by gay in my own humrous biting way arbuthnot is no more my friend who dares to irony pretend which i was born to introduce refined it first and shewed its use st john as well as pultney knows that i had some repute for prose and till they drove me out of date could maul a minister of state if they have mortified my pride and made me throw my pen aside if with such talents heavn has blest em have i not reason to detest em  to all my foes dear fortune send thy gifts but never to my friend i tamely can endure the first but this with envy makes me burst thus much may serve by way of proem proceed we therefore to our poem  the time is not remote when i must by the course of nature die when i foresee my special friends will try to find their private ends tho it is hardly understood which way my death can do them good yet thus methinks i hear em speak see how the dean begins to break poor gentleman he droops apace you plainly find it in his face that old vertigo in his head will never leave him till hes dead besides his memory decays he recollects not what he says he cannot call his friends to mind forgets the place where last he dined plyes you with stories oer and oer he told them fifty times before how does he fancy we can sit to hear his outoffashioned wit but he takes up with younger folks who for his wine will bear his jokes faith he must make his stories shorter or change his comrades once a quarter in half the time he talks them round there must another set be found  for poetry hes past his prime he takes an hour to find a rhyme his fire is out his wit decayed his fancy sunk his muse a jade id have him throw away his pen   but theres no talking to some men  and then their tenderness appears by adding largely to my years hes older than he would be reckoned and well remembers charles the second he hardly drinks a pint of wine and that i doubt is no good sign his stomach too begins to fail last year we thought him strong and hale but now hes quite another thing i wish he may hold out till spring then hug themselves and reason thus it is not yet so bad with us  in such a case they talk in tropes and by their fears express their hopes some great misfortune to portend no enemy can match a friend with all the kindness they profess the merit of a lucky guess when daily howdyes come of course and servants answer worse and worse would please em better than to tell that god be praised the dean is well then he who prophecied the best approves his foresight to the rest you know i always feared the worst and often told you so at first   hed rather choose that i should die than his prediction prove a lie not one foretells i shall recover but all agree to give me over  yet should some neighbour feel a pain just in the parts where i complain how many a message would he send what hearty prayers that i should mend inquire what regimen i kept what gave me ease and how i slept and more lament when i was dead than all the snivllers round my bed  my good companions never fear for though you may mistake a year though your prognostics run too fast they must be verified at last  behold the fatal day arrive how is the dean hes just alive now the departing prayer is read he hardly breathes the dean is dead  before the passingbell begun the news thro half the town has run o may we all for death prepare what has he left and whos his heir   i know no more that what the news is tis all bequeathed to public uses   to public use a perfect whim what had the public done for him mere envy avarice and pride he gave it all but first he died and had the dean in all the nation no worthy friend no poor relation so ready to do strangers good forgetting his own flesh and blood  now grub street wits are all employed with elegies the town is cloyed some paragraph in evry paper to curse the dean or bless the drapier  the doctors tender of their fame wisely on me lay all the blame we must confess his case was nice but he would never take advice had he been ruled for aught appears he might have lived these twenty years for when we opened him we found that all his vital parts were sound  from dublin soon to london spread tis told at court the dean is dead kind lady suffolk in the spleen runs laughing up to tell the queen the queen so gracious mild and good cries is he gone tis time he should hes dead you say why let him rot im glad the medals were forgot i promised him i own but when i only was a princess then but now as consort of a king you know tis quite a diffrent thing  now chartres at sir roberts levee tells with a sneer the tidings heavy why is he dead without his shoes cries bob im sorry for the news o were the wretch but living still and in his place my good friend will or had a mitre on his head provided bolinbroke were dead  now curll his shop from rubbish drains three genuine tomes of swifts remains and then to make them pass the glibber revised by tibbalds moore and cibber hell treat me as he does my betters publish my will my life my letters revive the libels born to die which pope must bear as well as i  here shift the scene to represent how those i love my death lament poor pope will grieve a month and gay a week and arbuthnot a day st john himself will scarce forbear to bite his pen and drop a tear the rest will give a shrug and cry im sorry but we all must die  indifference clad in wisdoms guise all fortitude of mind supplies for how can stony bowels melt in those who never pity felt when we are lashed they kiss the rod resigning to the will of god  the fools my juniors by a year are tortured with suspense and fear who wisely thought my age a screen when death approached to stand between   the screen removed their hearts are trembling they mourn for me without dissembling  my female friends whose tender hearts have better learned to act their parts receive the news in doleful dumps the dean is dead and what is trumps   then lord have mercy on his soul  ladies ill venture for the vole   six deans they say must bear the pall  i wish i knew what king to call   madam your husband will attend the funeral of so good a friend no madam tis a shocking sight and hes engaged tomorrow night my lady club would take it ill if he should fail her at quadrille he loved the dean i lead a heart   but dearest friends they say must part his time was come he ran his race we hope hes in a better place why do we grieve that friends should die no loss more easy to supply one year is past a different scene no further mention of the dean who now alas no more is missed than if he never did exist wheres now this favrite of apollo departed and his works must follow must undergo the common fate his kind of wit is out of date  some country squire to lintot goes inquires for swift in verse and prose says lintot i have heard the name he died a year ago the same he searches all the shop in vain sir you may find them in duck lane i sent them with a load of books last monday to the pastrycooks to fancy they could live a year i find youre but a stranger here the dean was famous in his time and had a kind of knack at rhyme his way of writing now is past the town has got a better taste i keep no antiquated stuff but spick and span i have enough pray do but give me leave to show em heres colley cibbers birthday poem this ode you never yet have seen by stephen duck upon the queen then heres a letter finely penned against the craftsman and his friend it clearly shows that all reflection on ministers is disaffection next heres sir roberts vindication and mr henleys last oration the hawkers have not got em yet   your honour please to buy a set heres woolstons tracts the twelfth edition tis read by evry politician the country members when in town to all their boroughs send them down you never met a thing so smart the courtiers have them all by heart those maids of honour who can read are taught to use them for their creed the revrend authors good intention has been rewarded with a pension he does an honour to his gown by bravely running priestcraft down he shows as sure as gods in gloucester that moses was a grand imposter that all his miracles were cheats performed as jugglers do their feats the church had never such a writer a shame he has not got a mitre  suppose me dead and then suppose a club assembled at the rose where from discourse of this and that i grow the subject of their chat and while they toss my name about with favour some and some without one quite indiffrent in the cause my character impartial draws  the dean if we believe report was never illreceived at court as for his works in verse and prose i own myself no judge of those nor can i tell what critics thought em but this i know all people bought em as with a moral view designed to cure the vices of mankind and if he often missed his aim the world must own it to their shame the praise is his and theirs the blame  sir i have heard another story he was a most confounded tory and grew or he is much belied extremely dull before he died  can we the drapier then forget is not our nation in his debt twas he that writ the drapiers letters  he should have left them for his betters we had a hundred abler men nor need depend upon his pen say what you will about his reading you never can defend his breeding who in his satires running riot could never leave the world in quiet attacking when he took the whim court city camp all one to him but why should he except he slobbert offend our patriot great sir robert whose counsels aid the sovreign power to save the nation every hour what scenes of evil he unravels in satires libels lying travels not sparing his own clergycloth but eats into it like a moth  his vein ironically grave exposed the fool and lashed the knave to steal a hint was never known but what he writ was all his own he never thought an honour done him because a duke was proud to own him would rather slip aside and choose to talk with wits in dirty shoes despised the fools with stars and garters so often seen caressing chartres he never courted men in station nor persons held in admiration of no mans greatness was afraid because he sought for no mans aid though trusted long in great affairs he gave himself no haughty airs without regarding private ends spent all his credit for his friends and only chose the wise and good no flatterers no allies in blood but succoured virtue in distress and seldom failed of good success as numbers in their hearts must own who but for him had been unknown with princes kept a due decorum but never stood in awe before em he followed davids lesson just in princes never put thy trust and would you make him truly sour provoke him with a slave in power the irish senate if you named with what impatience he declaimed fair liberty was all his cry for her he stood prepared to die for her he boldly stood alone for her he oft exposed his own two kingdoms just as faction led had set a price upon his head but not a traitor could be found to sell him for six hundred pound had he but spared his tongue and pen he might have rose like other men but power was never in his thought and wealth he valued not a groat ingratitude he often found and pitied those who meant the wound but kept the tenor of his mind to merit well of human kind nor made a sacrifice of those who still were true to please his foes he laboured many a fruitless hour to reconcile his friends in power saw mischief by a faction brewing while they pursued each others ruin but finding vain was all his care he left the court in mere despair and oh how short are human schemes here ended all our golden dreams what st johns skill in state affairs what ormonds valour oxfords cares to save their sinking country lent was all destroyed by one event too soon that precious life was ended on which alone our weal depended when up a dangerous faction starts with wrath and vengeance in their hearts by solemn league and covnant bound to ruin slaughter and confound to turn religion to a fable and make the government a babel pervert the laws disgrace the gown corrupt the senate rob the crown to sacrifice old englands glory and make her infamous in story   when such a tempest shook the land how could unguarded virtue stand with horror grief despair the dean beheld the dire destructive scene his friends in exile or the tower himself within the frown of power pursued by base envenomed pens far to the land of slaves and fens a servile race in folly nursed who truckle most when treated worst by innocence and resolution he bore continual persecution while numbers to preferment rose whose merits were to be his foes when evn his own familiar friends intent upon their private ends like renegadoes now he feels against him lifting up their heels the dean did by his pen defeat an infamous destructive cheat taught fools their intrest how to know and gave them arms to ward the blow envy has owned it was his doing to save that hapless land from ruin while they who at the steerage stood and reaped the profit sought his blood to save them from their evil fate in him was held a crime of state a wicked monster on the bench whose fury blood could never quench  as vile and profligate a villain as modern scroggs or old tresilian who long all justice had discarded nor feared he god nor man regarded   vowed on the dean his rage to vent and make him of his zeal repent but heaven his innocence defends the grateful people stand his friends not strains of law nor judges frown nor topics brought to please the crown nor witness hired nor jury picked prevail to bring him in convict in exile with a steady heart he spent his lifes declining part where folly pride and faction sway remote from st john pope and gay alas poor dean his only scope was to be held a misanthrope this into genral odium drew him which if he liked much good mayt do him his zeal was not to lash our crimes but discontent against the times for had we made him timely offers to raise his post or fill his coffers perhaps he might have truckled down like other brethren of his gown for party he would scarce have bled   i say no more because hes dead what writings has he left behind i hear theyre of a different kind a few in verse but most in prose  some highflown pamphlets i suppose   all scribbled in the worst of times to palliate his friend oxfords crimes to praise queen anne nay more defend her as never favring the pretender or libels yet concealed from sight against the court to show his spite perhaps his travels part the third a lie at every second word offensive to a loyal ear but not one sermon you may swear  his friendships there to few confined were always of the middling kind no fools of rank a mongrel breed who fain would pass for lords indeed where titles give no right or power and peerage is a withered flower he would have held it a disgrace if such a wretch had known his face on rural squires that kingdoms bane he vented oft his wrath in vain biennial squires to market brought who sell their souls and votes for nought the nation stripped go joyful back to rob the church their tenants rack go snacks with rogues and rapparees and keep the peace to pick up fees in every job to have a share a goal or barrack to repair and turn the tax for public roads commodious to their own abodes perhaps i may allow the dean had too much satire in his vein and seemed determined not to starve it because no age could more deserve it yet malice never was his aim he lashed the vice but spared the name no individual could resent where thousands equally were meant his satire points at no defect but what all mortals may correct for he abhorred that senseless tribe who call it humour when they gibe he spared a hump or crooked nose whose owners set not up for beaux true genuine dulness moved his pity unless it offered to be witty those who their ignornace confessed he neer offended with a jest but laughed to hear an idiot quote a verse from horace learned by rote vice if it eer can be abashed must be or ridiculed or lashed if you resent it whos to blame he neither knew you nor your name should vice expect to scape rebuke because its owner is a duke he knew an hundred pleasant stories with all the turns of whigs and tories was cheerful to his dying day and friends would let him have his way he gave what little wealth he had to build a house for fools and mad and showed by one satiric touch no nation wanted it so much that kingdom he hath left his debtor i wish it soon may have a better and since you dread no further lashes methinks you may forgive his ashes ,18,1667,1745,1
637,637,Jonathan Swift,all folks who pretend to religion and grace allow theres a hell but dispute of the place but if hell may by logical rules be defined the place of the damned ill tell you my mind wherever the damned do chiefly abound most certainly there is hell to be found damned poets damned critics damned blockheads damned knaves damned senators bribed damned prostitute slaves damned lawyers and judges damned lords and damned squires damned spies and informers damned friends and damned liars damned villains corrupted in every station damned timeserving priests all over the nation and into the bargain ill readily give you damned ignorant prelates and counsellors privy then let us no longer by parsons be flammed for we know by these marks the place of the damned and hell to be sure is at paris or rome how happy for us that it is not at home ,18,1667,1745,1
638,638,Jonathan Swift,stella this day is thirtyfour  we shant dispute a year or more however stella be not troubled although thy size and years are doubled since first i saw thee at sixteen the brightest virgin on the green so little is thy form declind made up so largely in thy mind  oh would it please the gods to split thy beauty size and years and wit no age could furnish out a pair of nymphs so graceful wise and fair with half the lustre of your eyes with half your wit your years and size and then before it grew too late how should i beg of gentle fate that either nymph might have her swain to split my worship too in twain ,18,1667,1745,1
639,639,Jonathan Swift,now hardly here and there a hackneycoach appearing showd the ruddy morns approach now betty from her masters bed had flown and softly stole to discompose her own the slipshod prentice from his masters door had pard the dirt and sprinkled round the floor now moll had whirld her mop with dextrous airs prepard to scrub the entry and the stairs the youth with broomy stumps began to trace the kenneledge where wheels had worn the place the smallcoal man was heard with cadence deep till drownd in shriller notes of chimneysweep duns at his lordships gate began to meet and brickdust moll had screamd through half a street the turnkey now his flock returning sees duly let out anights to steal for fees the watchful bailiffs take their silent stands and schoolboys lag with satchels in their hands ,18,1667,1745,1
640,640,Jonathan Swift,to the priest on observing how most men mistake their own talents when beasts could speak the learned say  they still can do so evry day it seems they had religion then as much as now we find in men it happend when a plague broke out which therefore made them more devout the king of brutes to make it plain of quadrupeds i only mean by proclamation gave command that evry subject in the land should to the priest confess their sins and thus the pious wolf begins  good father i must own with shame that often i have been to blame i must confess on friday last wretch that i was i broke my fast but i defy the basest tongue to prove i did my neighbour wrong or ever went to seek my food by rapine theft or thirst of blood  the ass approaching next confessd that in his heart he lovd a jest a wag he was he needs must own and could not let a dunce alone sometimes his friend he would not spare and might perhaps be too severe but yet the worst that could be said he was a wit both born and bred and if it be a sin or shame nature alone must bear the blame one fault he hath is sorry fort his ears are half a foot too short which could he to the standard bring hed show his face before the king then for his voice theres none disputes that hes the nightingale of brutes  the swine with contrite heart allowd his shape and beauty made him proud in diet was perhaps too nice but gluttony was neer his vice in evry turn of life content and meekly took what fortune sent inquire through all the parish round a better neighbour neer was found his vigilance might some displease tis true he hated sloth like peas  the mimic ape began his chatter how evil tongues his life bespatter much of the censring world complaind who said his gravity was feignd indeed the strictness of his morals engagd him in a hundred quarrels he saw and he was grievd to seet his zeal was sometimes indiscreet he found his virtues too severe for our corrupted times to bear yet such a lewd licentious age might well excuse a stoics rage  the goat advancd with decent pace and first excusd his youthful face forgiveness beggd that he appeard twas natures fault without a beard tis true he was not much inclind to fondness for the female kind not as his enemies object from chance or natural defect not by his frigid constitution but through a pious resolution for he had made a holy vow of chastity as monks do now which he resolvd to keep for ever hence as strictly too as doth his reverence  apply the tale and you shall find how just it suits with human kind some faults we own but can you guess whyvirtues carried to excess wherewith our vanity endows us though neither foe nor friend allows us  the lawyer swears you may rely ont he never squeezd a needy client and this he makes his constant rule for which his brethren call him fool his conscience always was so nice he freely gave the poor advice by which he lost he may affirm a hundred fees last easter term while others of the learned robe would break the patience of a job no pleader at the bar could match his diligence and quick dispatch neer kept a cause he well may boast above a term or two at most  the cringing knave who seeks a place without success thus tells his case why should he longer mince the matter he faild because he could not flatter he had not learnd to turn his coat nor for a party give his vote his crime he quickly understood too zealous for the nations good he found the ministers resent it yet could not for his heart repent it  the chaplain vows he cannot fawn though it would raise him to the lawn he passd his hours among his books you find it in his meagre looks he might if he were worldly wise preferment get and spare his eyes but ownd he had a stubborn spirit that made him trust alone in merit would rise by merit to promotion alas a mere chimeric notion  the doctor if you will believe him confessd a sin and god forgive him calld up at midnight ran to save a blind old beggar from the grave but see how satan spreads his snares he quite forgot to say his prayers he cannot help it for his heart sometimes to act the parsons part quotes from the bible many a sentence that moves his patients to repentance and when his medcines do no good supports their minds with heavnly food at which however well intended he hears the clergy are offended and grown so bold behind his back to call him hypocrite and quack in his own church he keeps a seat says grace before and after meat and calls without affecting airs his household twice a day to prayers he shuns apothecaries shops and hates to cram the sick with slops he scorns to make his art a trade nor bribes my ladys favrite maid old nursekeepers would never hire to recommend him to the squire which others whom he will not name have often practisd to their shame  the statesman tells you with a sneer his fault is to be too sincere and having no sinister ends is apt to disoblige his friends the nations good his masters glory without regard to whig or tory were all the schemes he had in view yet he was seconded by few though some had spread a hundred lies twas he defeated the excise twas known though he had borne aspersion that standing troops were his aversion his practice was in evry station to serve the king and please the nation though hard to find in evry case the fittest man to fill a place his promises he neer forgot but took memorials on the spot his enemies for want of charity said he affected popularity tis true the people understood that all he did was for their good their kind affections he has tried no love is lost on either side he came to court with fortune clear which now he runs out evry year must at the rate that he goes on inevitably be undone oh if his majesty would please to give him but a writ of ease would grant him licence to retire as it hath long been his desire by fair accounts it would be found hes poorer by ten thousand pound he owns and hopes it is no sin he neer was partial to his kin he thought it base for men in stations to crowd the court with their relations his country was his dearest mother and evry virtuous man his brother through modesty or awkward shame for which he owns himself to blame he found the wisest man he could without respect to friends or blood nor ever acts on private views when he hath liberty to choose  the sharper swore he hated play except to pass an hour away and well he might for to his cost by want of skill he always lost he heard there was a club of cheats who had contrivd a thousand feats could change the stock or cog a die and thus deceive the sharpest eye nor wonder how his fortune sunk his brothers fleece him when hes drunk  i own the moral not exact besides the tale is false in fact and so absurd that could i raise up from fields elysian fabling aesop i would accuse him to his face for libelling the fourfoot race creatures of evry kind but ours well comprehend their natural powrs while we whom reason ought to sway mistake our talents evry day the ass was never known so stupid to act the part of tray or cupid nor leaps upon his masters lap there to be strokd and fed with pap as aesop would the world persuade he better understands his trade nor comes wheneer his lady whistles but carries loads and feeds on thistles our authors meaning i presume is a creature bipes et implumis wherein the moralist designd a compliment on human kind for here he owns that now and then beasts may degenerate into men ,18,1667,1745,1

654,654,Thomas Warton,mother of musings contemplation sage whose grotto stands upon the topmost rock of teneriffe mid the tempestuous night on which in calmest meditation held thou hearst with howling winds the beating rain and drifting hail descend or if the skies unclouded shine and through the blue serene pale cynthia rolls her silveraxled car whence gazing steadfast on the spangled vault raptured thou sittst while murmurs indistinct of distant billows soothe thy pensive ear with hoarse and hollow sounds secure selfblest there oft thou listenst to the wild uproar of fleets encountring that in whispers low ascends the rocky summit where thou dwellst remote from man conversing with the spheres o lead me queen sublime to solemn glooms congenial with my soul to cheerless shades to ruind seats to twilight cells and bowers where thoughtful melancholy loves to muse her favorite midnight haunts the laughing scenes of purple spring where all the wanton train of smiles and graces seem to lead the dance in sportive round while from their hands they shower ambrosial blooms and flowers no longer charm tempe no more i court thy balmy breeze adieu green vales ye broiderd meads adieu beneath yon ruind abbeys mossgrown piles oft let me sit at twilight hour of eve where through some western window the pale moon pours her longlevelld rule of streaming light while sullen sacred silence reigns around save the lone screechowls note who builds his bower amid the mouldring caverns dark and damp or the calm breeze that rustles in the leaves of flaunting ivy that with mantle green invests some wasted tower or let me tread its neighbring walk of pines where musd of old the cloisterd brothers  thro the gloomy void that far extends beneath their ample arch as on i pace religious horror wraps my soul in dread repose but when the world is clad in midnights ravencolourd robe mid hollow charnel let me watch the flame of taper dim shedding a livid glare oer the wan heaps while airy voices talk along the glimmring walls or ghostly shape at distance seen invites with beckning hand my lonesome steps thro the farwinding vaults nor undelightful is the solemn noon of night when haply wakeful from my couch i start lo all is motionless around roars not the rushing wind the sons of men and every beast in mute oblivion lie all natures hushd in silence and in sleep o then how fearful is it to reflect that thro the still globes awful solitude no being wakes but me till stealing sleep my drooping temples bathes in opiate dews nor then let dreams of wanton folly born my senses lead thro flowry paths of joy but let the sacred genius of the night such mystic visions send as spenser saw when thro bewildring fancys magic maze to the fell house of busyrane he led th unshaken britomart or milton knew when in abstracted thought he first conceivd all heavn in tumult and the seraphim come towring armd in adamant and gold let others love soft summers evening smiles as listening to the distant waterfall they mark the blushes of the streaky west i choose the pale decembers foggy glooms then when the sullen shades of evening close where through the room a blindly glimmering gleam they dying embers scatter far remote from mirths mad shouts that through th illumined roof resound with festive echo let me sit blest with the lowly crickets drowsy dirge then let my thought contemplative explore this fleeting state of things the vain delights the fruitless toils that still our search elude as through the wilderness of life we rove this sober hour of silence will unmask false follys smile  that like the dazzling spells of wily comus cheat th unweeting eye with blear illusion and persuade to drink that charmed cup which reasons mintage fair unmoulds and stamps the monster on the man eager we taste but in the luscious draught forget the poisonous dregs that lurk beneath few know that elegance of soul refind whose soft sensation feels a quicker joy from melancholys scenes than the dull pride of tasteless splendour and magnificence can eer afford thus eloise whose mind had languishd to the pangs of melting love more genuine transport found as on some tomb reclind she watchd the tapers of the dead or thro the pillard aisles amid pale shrines of imagd saints and intermingled graves musd a veild votaress than flavia feels as thro the mazes of the festive ball proud of her conquering charms and beautys blaze she floats amid the silken sons of dress and shines the fairest of th assembled fair when azure noontide cheers the daedal globe and the blest regent of the golden day rejoices in his bright meridian tower how oft my wishes ask the nights return that best befriends the melancholy mind hail sacred night thou too shalt share my song sister of ebonscepterd hecate hail whether in congregated clouds thou wrappst thy viewless chariot or with silver crown thy beaming head encirclest ever hail what though beneath thy gloom the sorceress train far in obscured haunt of lapland moors with rhymes uncouth the bloody caldron bless though murder wan beneath thy shrouding shade summons her sloweyed votaries to devise of secret slaughter while by one blue lamp in hideous conference sits the listening band and start at each low wind or wakeful sound what though thy stay the pilgrim curseth oft as allbenighted in arabian wastes he hears the wilderness around him howl with roaming monsters while on his hoar head the blackdescending tempest ceaseless beats yet more delightful to my pensive mind is thy return than blooming morns approach een then in youthful pride of opening may when from the portals of the saffron east she sheds fresh roses and ambrosial dews yet not ungrateful is the morns approach when dropping wet she comes and clad in clouds while through the damp air scowls the lowering south blackening the landscapes face that grove and hill in formless vapours undistinguishd swim th afflicted of the saddend groves hail not the sullen gloom the waving elms that hoar through time and ranged in thick array enclose with stately row some rural hall are mute nor echo with the clamours hoarse of rooks rejoicing on their airy boughs while to the shed the dripping poultry crowd a mournful train secure the village hind hangs oer the crackling blaze nor tempts the storm fixd in unfinishd furrow furrow rests the plough rings not the high wood with enlivend shouts of early hunter all is silence drear and deeptest saness wraps the face of things thro popes soft song tho all the graces breathe and happiest art adorn his attic page yet does my mind with sweeter transport glow as at the root of mossy trunk reclind in magic spensers wildlywarbled song i see deserted una wander wide thro wasteful solitudes and lurid heaths weary forlorn than when the fated fair upon the bosom bright of silver thames launches in all the lustre of brocade amid the splendours of the laughing sun the gay description palls upon the sense and coldly strikes the mind with feeble bliss ye youths of albions beautyblooming isle whose brows have worn the wreath of luckless love is there a pleasure like the pensive mood whose magic wont to soothe your softend souls o tell how rapturous the joy to melt to melodys assuasive voice to bend th uncertain step along the midnight mead and pour your sorrows to the pitying moon by many a slow trill from the bird of woe oft interrupted in embowering woods by darksome brook to muse and there forget the solemn dulness of the tedious world while fancy grasps the visionary fair and now no more th abstracted ear attends the waters murmuring lapse th entranced eye pierces no longer through th extended rows of thickranged trees till haply from the depth the woodmans stroke or distant tinkling team or heifers rustling through the brake alarms th illuded sense and mars the golden dream these are delights that absence drear has made familiar to my soul eer since the form of young sapphira beauteous as the spring when from her violetwoven couch awaked by frolic zephyrs hand her tender cheek graceful she lifts and blushing from her bower issues to clothe in gladsomeglistering green the genial globe first met my dazzled sight these are delights unknown to minds profane and which alone the pensive soul can taste the taperd choir at the late hour of prayer oft let me tread while to th according voice the manysounding organ peals on high the clear slowdittied chant or varied hymn till all my soul is bathed in ecstasies and lappd in paradise or let me sit far in sequesterd aisles of the deep dome there lonesome listen to the sacred sounds which as they lengthen through the gothic vaults in hollow murmurs reach my ravishd ear nor when the lamps expiring yield to night and solitude returns would i forsake the solemn mansion but attentive mark the due clock swinging slow with sweepy sway measuring times flight with momentary sound  nor let me fail to cultivate my mind with the soft thrillings of the tragic muse divine melpomene sweet pitys nurse queen of the stately step and flowing pall now let monimia mourn streaming eyes her joys incestuous and polluted love now let soft juliet in the gaping tomb print the last kiss on her true romeos lips his lips yet reeking from the deadly draught or jaffier kneel for one forgiving look nor seldom let the moor on desdemone pour the misguided threats of jealous rage by soft degrees the manly torrent steals from my swollen eyes and at a brothers woe my big heart melts in sympathizing tears  what are the splendours of the gaudy court its tinsel trappings and its pageant pomps to me far happier seems the banishd lord amid siberias unrejoicing wilds who pines all lonesome in the chambers hoar of some high castle shut whose windows dim in distant ken discover trackless plains where winter ever whirls his icy car while still repeated objects of his view the gloomy battlements and ivied spires that crown the solitary dome arise while from the topmost turret the slow clock far heard along th inhospitable wastes with sadreturning chime awakes new grief evn he far happier seems than is the proud the potent satrap whom he left behind mid moscows golden palaces to drown in ease and luxury the laughing hours  illustrious objects strike the gazers mind with feeble bliss and but allure the sight nor rose with impulse quick th unfeeling heart thus seen by shepard from hymettus brow what daedal landscapes smile here palmy groves resounding once with platos voice arise amid whose umbrage green her silver head th unfading olive lifts here vineclad hills lay forth their purple store and sunny vales in prospect vast their level laps expand amid whose beauties glistering athens towers though through the blissful scenes ilissus roll his sageinspiring flood whose winding marge the thickwove laurel shades though roseate morn pour all her splendors on th empurpled scene yet fells the hoary hermit truer joys as from the cliff that oer his cavern hangs he views the piles of fallen persepolis in deep arrangement hide the darksome plain unbounded waste the mouldering obelisk here like a blasted oak ascends the clouds here parian domes their vaulted halls disclose horrid with thorn where lurks th unpitying thief whence flits the twilightloving bat at eve and the deaf adder wreaths her spotted train the dwellings once of elegance and art here temples rise amid whose hallowd bounds spires the black pine while through the naked street  once haunt of tradeful merchants springs the grass here columns heapd on prostrate columns torn from their firm base increase the mouldering mass far as the sight can pierce appear the spoils of sunk magnificence a blended scene of moles fanes arches domes and palaces where with his brother horror ruin sits  o come then melancholy queen of thought o come with saintly look and steadfast step from forth thy cave embowerd with mournful yew where ever to the curfews solemn sound listening thou sittst and with thy cypress bind thy votarys hair and seal him for thy son but never let euphrosyne beguile with toys of wanton mirth my fixed mind nor in my path her primrosegarland cast though mid her train the dimpled hebe bare her rosy bosom to th enamourd view though venus mother of the smiles and loves and bacchus ivycrownd in

the fierce achilles wrappd our walls in fire laid theb waste and slew my warlike sire his fate compassion in the victor bred stern as he was he yet reverd the dead his radiant arms preservd from

674,674,Alexander Pope,true ease in writing comes from art not chance as those move easiest who have learned to dance tis not enough no harshness gives offense the sound must seem an echo to the sense soft is the strain when zephyr gently blows and the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows but when loud surges lash the sounding shore the hoarse rough verse should like the torrent roar when ajax strives some rocks vast weight to throw the line too labors and the words move slow not so when swift camilla scours the plain flies oer the unbending corn and skims along the main hear how timotheus varied lays surprise and bid alternate passions fall and rise,33,1688,1744,1

677,677,Alexander Pope,tis hard to say if greater want of skill appear in writing or in judging ill but of the two less dangrous is th offence to tire our patience than mislead our sense some few in that but numbers err in this ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss a fool might once himself alone expose now one in verse makes many more in prose  tis with our judgments as our watches none go just alike yet each believes his own in poets as true genius is but rare true taste as seldom is the criticks share both must alike from heavn derive their light these born to judge as well as those to write let such teach others who themselves excell and censure freely who have written well authors are partial to their wit tis true but are not criticks to their judgment too  yet if we look more closely we shall find most have the seeds of judgment in their mind nature affords at least a glimmring light the lines tho touchd but faintly are drawn right but as the slightest sketch if justly tracd is by ill colouring but the more disgracd so by false learning is good sense defacd some are bewilderd in the maze of schools and some made coxcombs nature meant but fools in search of wit these lose their common sense and then turn criticks in their own defence each burns alike who can or cannot write or with a rivals or an eunuchs spite all fools have still an itching to deride and fain woud be upon the laughing side if maevius scribble in apollos spight there are who judge still worse than he can write  some have at first for wits then poets past turnd criticks next and provd plain fools at last some neither can for wits nor criticks pass as heavy mules are neither horse or ass those halflearnd witlings numrous in our isle as halfformd insects on the banks of nile unfinishd things one knows now what to call their generations so equivocal to tell em woud a hundred tongues require or one vain wits that might a hundred tire  but you who seek to give and merit fame and justly bear a criticks noble name be sure your self and your own reach to know how far your genius taste and learning go launch not beyond your depth but be discreet and mark that point where sense and dulness meet  nature to all things fixd the limits fit and wisely curbd proud mans pretending wit as on the land while here the ocean gains in other parts it leaves wide sandy plains thus in the soul while memory prevails the solid powr of understanding fails where beams of warm imagination play the memorys soft figures melt away one science only will one genius fit so vast is art so narrow human wit not only bounded to peculiar arts but oft in those confind to single parts like kings we lose the conquests gaind before by vain ambition still to make them more each might his sevral province well command woud all but stoop to what they understand  first follow nature and your judgment frame by her just standard which is still the same unerring nature still divinely bright one clear unchangd and universal light life force and beauty must to all impart at once the source and end and test of art art from that fund each just supply provides works without show and without pomp presides in some fair body thus th informing soul with spirits feeds with vigour fills the whole each motion guides and evry nerve sustains it self unseen but in th effects remains some to whom heavn in wit has been profuse want as much more to turn it to its use for wit and judgment often are at strife tho meant each others aid like man and wife tis more to guide than spur the muses steed restrain his fury than provoke his speed the winged courser like a genrous horse shows most true mettle when you check his course  those rules of old discoverd not devisd are nature still but nature methodizd nature like liberty is but restraind by the same laws which first herself ordaind  hear how learnd greece her useful rules indites when to repress and when indulge our flights high on parnassus top her sons she showd and pointed out those arduous paths they trod held from afar aloft th immortal prize and urgd the rest by equal steps to rise just precepts thus from great examples givn she drew from them what they derivd from heavn the genrous critick fannd the poets fire and taught the world with reason to admire then criticism the muses handmaid provd to dress her charms and make her more belovd but following wits from that intention strayd who coud not win the mistress wood the maid against the poets their own arms they turnd sure to hate most the men from whom they learnd so modern pothecaries taught the art by doctors bills to play the doctors part bold in the practice of mistaken rules prescribe apply and call their masters fools some on the leaves of ancient authors prey nor time nor moths eer spoild so much as they some dryly plain without inventions aid write dull receits how poems may be made these leave the sense their learning to display and theme explain the meaning quite away  you then whose judgment the right course woud steer know well each ancients proper character his fable subject scope in evry page religion country genius of his age without all these at once before your eyes cavil you may but never criticize be homers works your study and delight read them by day and meditate by night thence form your judgment thence your maxims bring and trace the muses upward to their spring still with it self compard his text peruse and let your comment be the mantuan muse  when first young maro in his boundless mind a work t outlast immortal rome designd perhaps he seemd above the criticks law and but from natures fountains scornd to draw but when texamine evry part he came nature and homer were he found the same convincd amazd he checks the bold design and rules as strict his labourd work confine as if the stagyrite oer looked each line learn hence for ancient rules a just esteem to copy nature is to copy them  some beauties yet no precepts can declare for theres a happiness as well as care musick resembles poetry in each are nameless graces which no methods teach and which a masterhand alone can reach if where the rules not far enough extend since rules were made but to promote their end some lucky licence answers to the full th intent proposd that licence is a rule thus pegasus a nearer way to take may boldly deviate from the common track great wits sometimes may gloriously offend and rise to faults true criticks dare not mend from vulgar bounds with brave disorder part and snatch a grace beyond the reach of art which without passing thro the judgment gains the heart and all its end at once attains in prospects thus some objects please our eyes which out of natures common order rise the shapeless rock or hanging precipice but tho the ancients thus their rules invade as kings dispense with laws themselves have made moderns beware or if you must offend against the precept neer transgress its end let it be seldom and compelld by need and have at least their precedent to plead the critick else proceeds without remorse seizes your fame and puts his laws in force  i know there are to whose presumptuous thoughts those freer beauties evn in them seem faults some figures monstrous and misshapd appear considerd singly or beheld too near which but proportiond to their light or place due distance reconciles to form and grace a prudent chief not always must display his powrs in equal ranks and fair array but with th occasion and the place comply conceal his force nay seem sometimes to fly those oft are stratagems which errors seem nor is it homer nods but we that dream  still green with bays each ancient altar stands above the reach of sacrilegious hands secure from flames from envys fiercer rage destructive war and allinvolving age see from each clime the learnd their incense bring hear in all tongues consenting paeans ring in praise so just let evry voice be joind and fill the genral chorus of mankind hail bards triumphant born in happier days immortal heirs of universal praise whose honours with increase of ages grow as streams roll down enlarging as they flow nations unborn your mighty names shall sound and worlds applaud that must not yet be found oh may some spark of your coelestial fire the last the meanest of your sons inspire that on weak wings from far pursues your flights glows while he reads but trembles as he writes to teach vain wits a science little known t admire superior sense and doubt their own    of all the causes which conspire to blind mans erring judgment and misguide the mind what the weak head with strongest byass rules is pride the neverfailing vice of fools whatever nature has in worth denyd she gives in large recruits of needful pride for as in bodies thus in souls we find what wants in blood and spirits swelld with wind pride where wit fails steps in to our defence and fills up all the mighty void of sense if once right reason drives that cloud away truth breaks upon us with resistless day trust not your self but your defects to know make use of evry friendand evry foe  a little learning is a dangrous thing drink deep or taste not the pierian spring there shallow draughts intoxicate the brain and drinking largely sobers us again fird at first sight with what the muse imparts in fearless youth we tempt the heights of arts while from the bounded level of our mind short views we take nor see the lengths behind but more advancd behold with strange surprize new distant scenes of endless science rise so pleasd at first the towring alps we try mount oer the vales and seem to tread the sky th eternal snows appear already past and the first clouds and mountains seem the last but those attaind we tremble to survey the growing labours of the lengthend way th increasing prospect tires our wandering eyes hills peep oer hills and alps on alps arise  a perfect judge will read each work of wit with the same spirit that its author writ survey the whole nor seek slight faults to find where nature moves and rapture warms the mind nor lose for that malignant dull delight the genrous pleasure to be charmd with wit but in such lays as neither ebb nor flow correctly cold and regularly low that shunning faults one quiet tenour keep we cannot blame indeedbut we may sleep in wit as nature what affects our hearts is nor th exactness of peculiar parts tis not a lip or eye we beauty call but the joint force and full result of all thus when we view some wellproportiond dome the worlds just wonder and evn thine o rome no single parts unequally surprize all comes united to th admiring eyes no monstrous height or breadth or length appear the whole at once is bold and regular  whoever thinks a faultless piece to see thinks what neer was nor is nor eer shall be in evry work regard the writers end since none can compass more than they intend and if the means be just the conduct true applause in spite of trivial faults is due as men of breeding sometimes men of wit t avoid great errors must the less commit neglect the rules each verbal critick lays for not to know some trifles is a praise most criticks fond of some subservient art still make the whole depend upon a part they talk of principles but notions prize and all to one lovd folly sacrifice  once on a time la manchas knight they say a certain bard encountring on the way discoursd in terms as just with looks as sage as eer coud dennis of the grecian stage concluding all were desprate sots and fools who durst depart from aristotles rules our author happy in a judge so nice producd his play and begd the knights advice made him observe the subject and the plot the manners passions unities what not all which exact to rule were brought about were but a combate in the lists left out what leave the combate out exclaims the knight yes or we must renounce the stagyrite not so by heavn he answers in a rage knights squires and steeds must enter on the stage so vast a throng the stage can neer contain then build a new or act it in a plain  thus criticks of less judgment than caprice curious not knowing not exact but nice form short ideas and offend in arts as most in manners by a love to parts  some to conceit alone their taste confine and glittring thoughts struck out at evry line pleasd with a work where nothings just or fit one glaring chaos and wild heap of wit poets like painters thus unskilld to trace the naked nature and the living grace with gold and jewels cover evry part and hide with ornaments their want of art true wit is nature to advantage drest what oft was thought but neer so well exprest something whose truth convincd at sight we find that gives us back the image of our mind as shades more sweetly recommend the light so modest plainness sets off sprightly wit for works may have more wit than does em good as bodies perish through excess of blood  others for language all their care express and value books as women men for dress their praise is stillthe stile is excellent the sense they humbly take upon content words are like leaves and where they most abound much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found false eloquence like the prismatic glass its gawdy colours spreads on evry place the face of nature was no more survey all glares alike without distinction gay but true expression like th unchanging sun clears and improves whateer it shines upon it gilds all objects but it alters none expression is the dress of thought and still appears more decent as more suitable a vile conceit in pompous words exprest is like a clown in regal purple drest for diffrent styles with diffrent subjects sort as several garbs with country town and court some by old words to fame have made pretence ancients in phrase meer moderns in their sense such labourd nothings in so strange a style amaze thunlearnd and make the learned smile unlucky as fungoso in the play these sparks with aukward vanity display what the fine gentleman wore yesterday and but so mimick ancient wits at best as apes our grandsires in their doublets treat in words as fashions the same rule will hold alike fantastick if too new or old be not the first by whom the new are tryd nor yet the last to lay the old aside  but most by numbers judge a poets song and smooth or rough with them is right or wrong in the bright muse tho thousand charms conspire her voice is all these tuneful fools admire who haunt parnassus but to please their ear not mend their minds as some to church repair not for the doctrine but the musick there these equal syllables alone require tho oft the ear the open vowels tire while expletives their feeble aid do join and ten low words oft creep in one dull line while they ring round the same unvaryd chimes with sure returns of still expected rhymes whereeer you find the cooling western breeze in the next line it whispers thro the trees if chrystal streams with pleasing murmurs creep the readers threatend not in vain with sleep then at the last and only couplet fraught with some unmeaning thing they call a thought a needless alexandrine ends the song that like a wounded snake drags its slow length along leave such to tune their own dull rhimes and know whats roundly smooth or languishingly slow and praise the easie vigor of a line where denhams strength and wallers sweetness join true ease in writing comes from art not chance as those move easiest who have learnd to dance tis not enough no harshness gives offence the sound must seem an eccho to the sense soft is the strain when zephyr gently blows and the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows but when loud surges lash the sounding shore the hoarse rough verse shoud like the torrent roar when ajax strives some rocks vast weight to throw the line too labours and the words move slow not so when swift camilla scours the plain flies oer thunbending corn and skims along the main hear how timotheus varyd lays surprize and bid alternate passions fall and rise while at each change the son of lybian jove now burns with glory and then melts with love now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow now sighs steal out and tears begin to flow persians and greeks like turns of nature found and the worlds victor stood subdud by sound the powrs of musick all our hearts allow and what timotheus was is dryden now  avoid extreams and shun the fault of such who still are pleasd too little or too much at evry trifle scorn to take offence that always shows great pride or little sense those heads as stomachs are not sure the best which nauseate all and nothing can digest yet let not each gay turn thy rapture move for fools admire but men of sense approve as things seem large which we thro mists descry dulness is ever apt to magnify  some foreign writers some our own despise the ancients only or the moderns prize thus wit like faith by each man is applyd to one small sect and all are damnd beside meanly they seek the blessing to confine and force that sun but on a part to shine which not alone the southern wit sublimes but ripens spirits in cold northern climes which from the first has shone on ages past enlights the present and shall warm the last tho each may feel increases and decays and see now clearer and now darker days regard not then if wit be old or new but blame the false and value still the true  some neer advance a judgment of their own but catch the spreading notion of the town they reason and conclude by precedent and own stale nonsense which they neer invent some judge of authors names not works and then nor praise nor blame the writings but the men of all this servile herd the worst is he that in proud dulness joins with quality a constant critick at the greatmans board to fetch and carry nonsense for my lord what woful stuff this madrigal woud be to some starvd hackny sonneteer or me but let a lord once own the happy lines how the wit brightens how the style refines before his sacred name flies evry fault and each exalted stanza teems with thought  the vulgar thus through imitation err as oft the learnd by being singular so much they scorn the crowd that if the throng by chance go right they purposely go wrong so schismatics the plain believers quit and are but damnd for having too much wit  some praise at morning what they blame at night but always think the last opinion right a muse by these is like a mistress usd this hour shes idolizd the next abusd while their weak heads like towns unfortifyd twixt sense and nonsense daily change their side ask them the cause theyre wiser still they say and still to morrows wiser than to day we think our fathers fools so wise we grow our wiser sons no doubt will think us so once schooldivines this zealous isle oerspread who knew most sentences was deepest read faith gospel all seemd made to be disputed and none had sense enough to be confuted scotists and thomists now in peace remain amidst their kindred cobwebs in ducklane if faith it self has diffrent dresses worn what wonder modes in wit shoud take their turn oft leaving what is natural and fit the current folly proves the ready wit and authors think their reputation safe which lives as long as fools are pleasd to laugh  some valuing those of their own side or mind still make themselves the measure of mankind fondly we think we honour merit then when we but praise our selves in other men parties in wit attend on those of state and publick faction doubles private hate pride malice folly against dryden rose in various shapes of parsons criticks beaus but sense survivd when merry jests were past for rising merit will buoy up at last might he return and bless once more our eyes new blackmores and new milbourns must arise nay shoud great homer lift his awful head zoilus again would start up from the dead envy will merit as its shade pursue but like a shadow proves the substance true for envyd wit like sol eclipsd makes known th opposing bodys grossness not its own when first that sun too powerful beams displays it draws up vapours which obscure its rays but evn those clouds at last adorn its way reflect new glories and augment the day  be thou the first true merit to befriend his praise is lost who stays till all commend short is the date alas of modern rhymes and tis but just to let em live betimes no longer now that golden age appears when patriarchwits survivd thousand years now length of fame our second life is lost and bare threescore is all evn that can boast our sons their fathers failing language see and such as chaucer is shall dryden be so when the faithful pencil has designd some bright idea of the masters mind where a new world leaps out at his command and ready nature waits upon his hand when the ripe colours soften and unite and sweetly melt into just shade and light when mellowing years their full perfection give and each bold figure just begins to live the treachrous colours the fair art betray and all the bright creation fades away  unhappy wit like most mistaken things attones not for that envy which it brings in youth alone its empty praise we boast but soon the shortlivd vanity is lost like some fair flowr the early spring supplies that gaily blooms but evn in blooming dies what is this wit which must our cares employ the owners wife that other men enjoy then most our trouble still when most admird and still the more we give the more requird whose fame with pains we guard but lose with ease sure some to vex but never all to please tis what the vicious fear the virtuous shun by fools tis hated and by knaves undone  if wit so much from ignrance undergo ah let not learning too commence its foe of old those met rewards who coud excel and such were praisd who but endeavourd well tho triumphs were to genrals only due crowns were reservd to grace the soldiers too now they who reached parnassus lofty crown employ their pains to spurn some others down and while selflove each jealous writer rules contending wits becomes the sport of fools but still the worst with most regret commend for each ill author is as bad a friend to what base ends and by what abject ways are mortals urgd thro sacred lust of praise ah neer so dire a thirst of glory boast nor in the critick let the man be lost goodnature and goodsense must ever join to err is humane to forgive divine  but if in noble minds some dregs remain not yet purgd off of spleen and sowr disdain discharge that rage on more provoking crimes nor fear a dearth in these flagitious times no pardon vile obscenity should find tho wit and art conspire to move your mind but dulness with obscenity must prove as shameful sure as importance in love in the fat age of pleasure wealth and ease sprung the rank weed and thrivd with large increase when love was all an easie monarchs care seldom at council never in a war jilts ruld the state and statesmen farces writ nay wits had pensions and young lords had wit the fair sate panting at a courtiers play and not a mask went unimprovd away the modest fan was liked up no more and virgins smild at what they blushd before the following licence of a foreign reign did all the dregs of bold socinus drain then unbelieving priests reformd the nation and taught more pleasant methods of salvation where heavns free subjects might their rights dispute lest god himself shoud seem too absolute pulpits their sacred satire learnd to spare and vice admird to find a flattrer there encouragd thus witts titans bravd the skies and the press groand with licencd blasphemies these monsters criticks with your darts engage here point your thunder and exhaust your rage yet shun their fault who scandalously nice will needs mistake an author into vice all seems infected that th infected spy as all looks yellow to the jaundicd eye  learn then what morals criticks ought to show for tis but half a judges task to know tis not enough taste judgment learning join in all you speak let truth and candor shine that not alone what to your sense is due all may allow but seek your friendship too  be silent always when you doubt your sense and speak tho sure with seeming diffidence some positive persisting fops we know who if once wrong will needs be always so but you with pleasure own your errors past an make each day a critick on the last  tis not enough your counsel still be true blunt truths more mischief than nice falsehood do men must be taught as if you taught them not and things unknown proposd as things forgot without good breeding truth is disapprovd that only makes superior sense belovd  be niggards of advice on no pretence for the worst avarice is that of sense with mean complacence neer betray your trust nor be so civil as to prove unjust fear not the anger of the wise to raise those best can bear reproof who merit praise  twere well might criticks still this freedom take but appius reddens at each word you speak and stares tremendous with a threatning eye like some fierce tyrant in old tapestry fear most to tax an honourable fool whose right it is uncensurd to be dull such without wit are poets when they please as without learning they can take degrees leave dangrous truths to unsuccessful satyrs and flattery to fulsome dedicators whom when they praise the world believes no more than when they promise to give scribling oer tis best sometimes your censure to restrain and charitably let the dull be vain your silence there is better than your spite for who can rail so long as they can write still humming on their drowzy course they keep and lashd so long like tops are lashd asleep false steps but help them to renew the race as after stumbling jades will mend their pace what crouds of these impenitently bold in sounds and jingling syllables grown old still run on poets in a raging vein evn to the dregs and squeezings of the brain strain out the last dull droppings of their sense and rhyme with all the rage of impotence  such shameless bards we have and yet tis true there are as mad abandond criticks too the bookful blockhead ignorantly read with loads of learned lumber in his head with his own tongue still edifies his ears and always listning to himself appears all books he reads and all he reads assails from drydens fables down to durfeys tales with him most authors steal their works or buy garth did not write his own dispensary name a new play and hes the poets friend nay showd his faultsbut when woud poets mend no place so sacred from such fops is barrd nor is pauls church more safe than pauls churchyard nay fly to altars there theyll talk you dead for fools rush in where angels fear to tread distrustful sense with modest caution speaks it still looks home and short excursions makes but ratling nonsense in full vollies breaks and never shockd and never turnd aside bursts out resistless with a thundering tyde  but wheres the man who counsel can bestow still pleasd to teach and not proud to know unbiassd or by favour or by spite not dully prepossest nor blindly right tho learnd wellbred and tho wellbred sincere modestly bold and humanly severe who to a friend his faults can freely show and gladly praise the merit of a foe blest with a taste exact yet unconfind a knowledge both of books and humankind genrous converse a sound exempt from pride and love to praise with reason on his side  such once were criticks such the happy few athens and rome in better ages knew the mighty stagyrite first left the shore spread all his sails and durst the deeps explore he steerd securely and discoverd far led by the light of the maeonian star poets a race long unconfind and free still fond and proud of savage liberty receivd his laws and stood convincd twas fit who conquerd nature shoud preside oer wit  horace still charms with graceful negligence and without method talks us into sense will like a friend familarly convey the truest notions in the easiest way he who supream in judgment as in wit might boldly censure as he boldly writ yet judgd with coolness tho he sung with fire his precepts teach but what his works inspire our criticks take a contrary extream they judge with fury but they write with fleme nor suffers horace more in wrong translations by wits than criticks in as wrong quotations  see dionysius homers thoughts refine and call new beauties forth from evry line  fancy and art in gay petronius please the scholars learning with the courtiers ease  in grave quintilians copious work we find the justest rules and clearest method joind thus useful arms in magazines we place all rangd in order and disposd with grace but less to please the eye than arm the hand still fit for use and ready at command  thee bold longinus all the nine inspire and bless their critick with a poets fire an ardent judge who zealous in his trust with warmth gives sentence yet is always just whose own example strengthens all his laws and is himself that great sublime he draws  thus long succeeding criticks justly reignd licence repressd and useful laws ordaind learning and rome alike in empire grew and arts still followd where her eagles flew from the same foes at last both felt their doom and the same age saw learning fall and rome with tyranny then superstition joind as that the body this enslavd the mind much was believd but little

680,680,Alexander Pope,in these deep solitudes and awful cells  where heavnlypensive contemplation dwells and evermusing melancholy reigns what means this tumult in a vestals veins why rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat why feels my heart its longforgotten heat yet yet i lovefrom abelard it came and eloisa yet must kiss the name  dear fatal name rest ever unreveald nor pass these lips in holy silence seald hide it my heart within that close disguise where mixd with gods his lovd idea lies o write it not my handthe name appears already writtenwash it out my tears in vain lost eloisa weeps and prays her heart still dictates and her hand obeys  relentless walls whose darksome round contains repentant sighs and voluntary pains ye rugged rocks which holy knees have worn ye grots and caverns shaggd with horrid thorn shrines where their vigils paleeyd virgins keep and pitying saints whose statues learn to weep though cold like you unmovd and silent grown i have not yet forgot myself to stone all is not heavns while abelard has part still rebel nature holds out half my heart nor prayrs nor fasts its stubborn pulse restrain nor tears for ages taught to flow in vain  soon as thy letters trembling i unclose that wellknown name awakens all my woes oh name for ever sad for ever dear still breathd in sighs still usherd with a tear i tremble too whereer my own i find some dire misfortune follows close behind line after line my gushing eyes oerflow led through a sad variety of woe now warm in love now withring in thy bloom lost in a convents solitary gloom there stern religion quenchd th unwilling flame there died the best of passions love and fame  yet write oh write me all that i may join griefs to thy griefs and echo sighs to thine nor foes nor fortune take this powr away and is my abelard less kind than they tears still are mine and those i need not spare love but demands what else were shed in prayr no happier task these faded eyes pursue to read and weep is all they now can do  then share thy pain allow that sad relief ah more than share it give me all thy grief heavn first taught letters for some wretchs aid some banishd lover or some captive maid they live they speak they breathe what love inspires warm from the soul and faithful to its fires the virgins wish without her fears impart excuse the blush and pour out all the heart speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul and waft a sigh from indus to the pole  thou knowst how guiltless first i met thy flame when love approachd me under friendships name my fancy formd thee of angelic kind some emanation of th allbeauteous mind those smiling eyes attempring evry day shone sweetly lambent with celestial day guiltless i gazd heavn listend while you sung and truths divine came mended from that tongue from lips like those what precept faild to move too soon they taught me twas no sin to love back through the paths of pleasing sense i ran nor wishd an angel whom i lovd a man dim and remote the joys of saints i see nor envy them that heavn i lose for thee  how oft when pressd to marriage have i said curse on all laws but those which love has made love free as air at sight of human ties spreads his light wings and in a moment flies let wealth let honour wait the wedded dame august her deed and sacred be her fame before true passion all those views remove fame wealth and honour what are you to love the jealous god when we profane his fires those restless passions in revenge inspires and bids them make mistaken mortals groan who seek in love for aught but love alone should at my feet the worlds great master fall himself his throne his world id scorn em all not caesars empress would i deign to prove no make me mistress to the man i love if there be yet another name more free more fond than mistress make me that to thee oh happy state when souls each other draw when love is liberty and nature law all then is full possessing and possessd no craving void left aching in the breast evn thought meets thought ere from the lips it part and each warm wish springs mutual from the heart this sure is bliss if bliss on earth there be and once the lot of abelard and me  alas how changd what sudden horrors rise a naked lover bound and bleeding lies where where was eloise her voice her hand her poniard had opposd the dire command barbarian stay that bloody stroke restrain the crime was common common be the pain i can no more by shame by rage suppressd let tears and burning blushes speak the rest  canst thou forget that sad that solemn day when victims at yon altars foot we lay canst thou forget what tears that moment fell when warm in youth i bade the world farewell as with cold lips i kissd the sacred veil the shrines all trembld and the lamps grew pale heavn scarce believd the conquest it surveyd and saints with wonder heard the vows i made yet then to those dread altars as i drew not on the cross my eyes were fixd but you not grace or zeal love only was my call and if i lose thy love i lose my all come with thy looks thy words relieve my woe those still at least are left thee to bestow still on that breast enamourd let me lie still drink delicious poison from thy eye pant on thy lip and to thy heart be pressd give all thou canstand let me dream the rest ah no instruct me other joys to prize with other beauties charm my partial eyes full in my view set all the bright abode and make my soul quit abelard for god  ah think at least thy flock deserves thy care plants of thy hand and children of thy prayr from the false world in early youth they fled by thee to mountains wilds and deserts led you raisd these hallowd walls the desert smild and paradise was opend in the wild no weeping orphan saw his fathers stores our shrines irradiate or emblaze the floors no silver saints by dying misers givn here bribd the rage of illrequited heavn but such plain roofs as piety could raise and only vocal with the makers praise in these lone walls their days eternal bound these mossgrown domes with spiry turrets crownd where awful arches make a noonday night and the dim windows shed a solemn light thy eyes diffusd a reconciling ray and gleams of glory brightend all the day but now no face divine contentment wears tis all blank sadness or continual tears see how the force of others prayrs i try o pious fraud of amrous charity but why should i on others prayrs depend come thou my father brother husband friend ah let thy handmaid sister daughter move and all those tender names in one thy love the darksome pines that oer yon rocks reclind wave high and murmur to the hollow wind the wandring streams that shine between the hills the grots that echo to the tinkling rills the dying gales that pant upon the trees the lakes that quiver to the curling breeze no more these scenes my meditation aid or lull to rest the visionary maid but oer the twilight groves and dusky caves longsounding aisles and intermingled graves black melancholy sits and round her throws a deathlike silence and a dread repose her gloomy presence saddens all the scene shades evry flowr and darkens evry green deepens the murmur of the falling floods and breathes a browner horror on the woods  yet here for ever ever must i stay sad proof how well a lover can obey death only death can break the lasting chain and here evn then shall my cold dust remain here all its frailties all its flames resign and wait till tis no sin to mix with thine  ah wretch believd the spouse of god in vain confessd within the slave of love and man assist me heavn but whence arose that prayr sprung it from piety or from despair evn here where frozen chastity retires love finds an altar for forbidden fires i ought to grieve but cannot what i ought i mourn the lover not lament the fault i view my crime but kindle at the view repent old pleasures and solicit new now turnd to heavn i weep my past offence now think of thee and curse my innocence of all affliction taught a lover yet tis sure the hardest science to forget how shall i lose the sin yet keep the sense and love th offender yet detest th offence how the dear object from the crime remove or how distinguish penitence from love unequal task a passion to resign for hearts so touchd so piercd so lost as mine ere such a soul regains its peaceful state how often must it love how often hate how often hope despair resent regret conceal disdaindo all things but forget but let heavn seize it all at once tis fird not touchd but rapt not wakend but inspird oh come oh teach me nature to subdue renounce my love my life myselfand you fill my fond heart with god alone for he alone can rival can succeed to thee  how happy is the blameless vestals lot the world forgetting by the world forgot eternal sunshine of the spotless mind each prayr accepted and each wish resignd labour and rest that equal periods keep obedient slumbers that can wake and weep desires composd affections ever evn tears that delight and sighs that waft to heavn grace shines around her with serenest beams and whispring angels prompt her golden dreams for her th unfading rose of eden blooms and wings of seraphs shed divine perfumes for her the spouse prepares the bridal ring for her white virgins hymeneals sing to sounds of heavnly harps she dies away and melts in visions of eternal day  far other dreams my erring soul employ far other raptures of unholy joy when at the close of each sad sorrowing day fancy restores what vengeance snatchd away then conscience sleeps and leaving nature free all my loose soul unbounded springs to thee oh cursd dear horrors of allconscious night how glowing guilt exalts the keen delight provoking daemons all restraint remove and stir within me every source of love i hear thee view thee gaze oer all thy charms and round thy phantom glue my clasping arms i wakeno more i hear no more i view the phantom flies me as unkind as you i call aloud it hears not what i say i stretch my empty arms it glides away to dream once more i close my willing eyes ye soft illusions dear deceits arise alas no moremethinks we wandring go through dreary wastes and weep each others woe where round some mouldring tower pale ivy creeps and lowbrowd rocks hang nodding oer the deeps sudden you mount you beckon from the skies clouds interpose waves roar and winds arise i shriek start up the same sad prospect find and wake to all the griefs i left behind  for thee the fates severely kind ordain a cool suspense from pleasure and from pain thy life a long dead calm of fixd repose no pulse that riots and no blood that glows still as the sea ere winds were taught to blow or moving spirit bade the waters flow soft as the slumbers of a saint forgivn and mild as opening gleams of promisd heavn  come abelard for what hast thou to dread the torch of venus burns not for the dead nature stands checkd religion disapproves evn thou art coldyet eloisa loves ah hopeless lasting flames like those that burn to light the dead and warm th unfruitful urn  what scenes appear whereer i turn my view the dear ideas where i fly pursue rise in the grove before the altar rise stain all my soul and wanton in my eyes i waste the matin lamp in sighs for thee thy image steals between my god and me thy voice i seem in evry hymn to hear with evry bead i drop too soft a tear when from the censer clouds of fragrance roll and swelling organs lift the rising soul one thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight priests tapers temples swim before my sight in seas of flame my plunging soul is drownd while altars blaze and angels tremble round  while prostrate here in humble grief i lie kind virtuous drops just gathring in my eye while praying trembling in the dust i roll and dawning grace is opning on my soul come if thou darst all charming as thou art oppose thyself to heavn dispute my heart come with one glance of those deluding eyes blot out each bright idea of the skies take back that grace those sorrows and those tears take back my fruitless penitence and prayrs snatch me just mounting from the blest abode assist the fiends and tear me from my god  no fly me fly me far as pole from pole rise alps between us and whole oceans roll ah come not write not think not once of me nor share one pang of all i felt for thee thy oaths i quit thy memory resign forget renounce me hate whateer was mine fair eyes and tempting looks which yet i view long lovd adord ideas all adieu oh grace serene oh virtue heavnly fair divine oblivion of lowthoughted care fresh blooming hope gay daughter of the sky and faith our early immortality enter each mild each amicable guest receive and wrap me in eternal rest  see in her cell sad eloisa spread proppd on some tomb a neighbour of the dead in each low wind methinks a spirit calls and more than echoes talk along the walls here as i watchd the dying lamps around from yonder shrine i heard a hollow sound come sister come it said or seemd to say thy place is here sad sister come away once like thyself i trembled wept and prayd loves victim then though now a sainted maid but all is calm in this eternal sleep here grief forgets to groan and love to weep evn superstition loses evry fear for god not man absolves our frailties here  i come i come prepare your roseate bowrs celestial palms and everblooming flowrs thither where sinners may have rest i go where flames refind in breasts seraphic glow thou abelard the last sad office pay and smooth my passage to the realms of day see my lips tremble and my eyeballs roll suck my last breath and catch my flying soul ah noin sacred vestments mayst thou stand the hallowd taper trembling in thy hand present the cross before my lifted eye teach me at once and learn of me to die ah then thy oncelovd eloisa see it will be then no crime to gaze on me see from my cheek the transient roses fly see the last sparkle languish in my eye till evry motion pulse and breath be oer and evn my abelard be lovd no more o death alleloquent you only prove what dust we dote on when tis man we love  then too when fate shall thy fair frame destroy that cause of all my guilt and all my joy in trance ecstatic may thy pangs be drownd bright clouds descend and angels watch thee round from opning skies may streaming glories shine and saints embrace thee with a love like mine  may one kind grave unite each hapless name and graft my love immortal on thy fame then ages hence when all my woes are oer when this rebellious heart shall beat no more if ever chance two wandring lovers brings to paracletes white walls and silver springs oer the pale marble shall they join their heads and drink the falling tears each other sheds then sadly say with mutual pity movd oh may we never love as these have lovd  from the full choir when loud hosannas rise and swell the pomp of dreadful sacrifice amid that scene if some relenting eye glance on the stone where our cold relics lie devotions self shall steal a thought from heavn one human tear shall drop and be forgivn and sure if fate some future bard shall join in sad similitude of griefs to mine condemnd whole years in absence to deplore and image charms he must behold no more such if there be who loves so long so well let him our sad our tender story tell the wellsung woes will soothe my pensive

then grave clarissa graceful wavd her fan silence ensud and thus the nymph began  say why are beauties praisd and honourd most the wise mans passion and the vain mans toast why deckd with all that land and sea afford why angels calld and angellike adord why round our coaches crowd the whiteglovd beaus why bows the sidebox from its inmost rows how vain are all these glories all our pains unless good sense preserve what beauty gains that men may say when we the frontbox grace behold the first in virtue as in face oh if to dance all night and dress all day charmd the smallpox or chasd old age away who would not scorn what huswifes cares produce or who would learn one earthly thing of use to patch nay ogle might become a saint nor could it sure be such a sin to paint but since alas frail beauty must decay curld or uncurld since locks will turn to grey since paintd or not paintd all shall fade and she who scorns a man must die a maid what then remains but well our powr to use and keep good humour still whateer we lose  and trust me dear good humour can prevail when airs and flights and screams and scolding fail beauties in vain their pretty eyes may roll charms strike the sight but

scales in air weighs the mens wits against the ladys hair the doubtful beam long nods from side to side at length the wits mount up the hairs subside  see fierce belinda on the baron flies with more than usual lightning in her eyes nor feard the chief th unequal fight to try who sought no more than on his foe to die but this bold lord with manly strength indud she with one finger and a thumb

each eye oerflows and the high dome reecchoes to his nose  now meet thy fate incensd belinda cryd and drew a deadly bodkin from her side the same his ancient personage to deck her great great grandsire wore about his neck  in three sealrings which after melted down formd a vast buckle for his widows gown her infant grandames whistle next it grew the bells she gingled and the whistle blew then in a bodkin gracd her mothers hairs which long she wore and now belinda wears  boast not my fall he cryd insulting foe thou by some other shalt be laid as low nor think to die dejects my lofty

roofs rebound not fierce othello in so loud a strain roard for the handkerchief that causd his pain but see how oft ambitious aims are crossd and chiefs contend till all the prize is lost the lock obtaind with guilt and kept with pain in evry place is sought but sought in vain  with such a prize no mortal must be blest so heavn decrees with heavn who can contest  some thought it mounted to the lunar sphere since all things lost on earth are treasurd there there heroes wits are kept in pondrous vases and beaus in snuffboxes and tweezercases there broken vows and deathbed alms are found and lovers hearts with ends of riband bound the courtiers promises and sick mans prayrs the smiles of harlots and the tears of heirs  cages for gnats and chains to yoak a flea dryd butterflies and tomes of casuistry  but trust the museshe saw it upward rise tho markd by none but quick poetic eyes so romes great founder to the heavns withdrew to proculus alone confessd in view a sudden star it shot thro liquid air and drew behind a radiant trail of hair not berenices locks first rose so bright the heavns bespangling with disheveld light  the sylphs behold it kindling as it flies and pleasd pursue its progress thro the skies  this the beaumonde shall from the mall survey and hail with musick its propitious ray this the blest lover shall for venus take and send up vows from rosamondas lake this partridge soon shall view in cloudless skies when next he looks thro galilaeos eyes and hence th egregious wizard shall foredoom the fate of louis and the fall of rome   then cease bright nymph to mourn the ravishd hair which adds new glory to the shining sphere not all the tresses that fair head can boast shall draw such envy as the lock you lost for after all the murders of your eye

dwells such mighty rage  sol thro white curtains shot a timrous ray and opd those eyes that must eclipse the day now lapdogs give themselves the rousing shake and sleepless lovers just at twelve awake thrice rung the bell the slipper knockd the ground and the pressd watch returnd a silver sound belinda still her downy pillow pressd her guardian sylph prolongd the balmy rest twas he had summond to her silent bed the morning dream that hoverd oer her head a youth more glittring than a birthnight beau that evn in slumber causd her cheek to glow seemd to her ear his winning lips to lay and thus in whispers said or seemd to say  fairest of mortals thou distinguishd care of thousand bright inhabitants of air if eer one vision touchd thy infant thought of all the nurse and all the priest have taught of airy elves by moonlight shadows seen the silver token and the circled green or virgins visited by angel powrs with golden crowns and wreaths of heavnly flowrs hear and believe thy own importance know nor bound thy narrow views to things below some secret truths from learned pride conceald to maids alone and children are reveald what tho no credit doubting wits may give the fair and innocent shall still believe know then unnumberd spirits round thee fly the light militia of the lower sky these though unseen are ever on theg hang oer the box and hover round the ring think what an equipage thou hast in air and view with scorn two pages and a chair as now your own our beings were of old and once inclosd in womans beauteous mould thence by a soft transition we repair from earthly vehicles to these of air think not when womans transient breath is fled that all her vanities at once are dead succeeding vanities she still regards and tho she plays no more oerlooks the cards her joy in gilded chariots when alive and love of ombre after death survive for when the fair in all their pride expire to their first elements their souls retire the sprites of fiery termagants in flame

with men below  some nymphs there are too conscious of their face for life predestind to the gnomes embrace these swell their prospects and exalt their pride when offers are disdaind and love denied then gay ideas crowd the vacant brain while peers and dukes and all their sweeping train and garters stars and coronets appear and in soft sounds your grace salutes their ear tis these that early taint the female soul instruct the eyes of young coquettes to roll teach infant cheeks a bidden blush to know and little hearts to flutter at a beau  oft when the world imagine women stray the sylphs through mystic mazes guide their way thro all the giddy circle they pursue and old impertinence expel by new what tender maid but must a victim fall to one mans treat but for anothers ball when florio speaks what virgin could withstand if gentle damon did not squeeze her hand with varying vanities from evry part they shift the moving toyshop of their heart where wigs with wigs with swordknots

not ardent lovers robbd of all their bliss not ancient ladies when refusd a kiss not tyrants fierce that unrepenting die not cynthia when her manteaus pinnd awry eer felt such rage resentment and despair as thou sad virgin for thy ravishd hair  for that sad moment when the sylphs withdrew and ariel weeping from belinda flew umbriel a dusky melancholy sprite as ever sullied the fair face of light down to the central earth his proper scene repaird to search the gloomy cave of spleen  swift on his sooty pinions flits the gnome and in a vapour reachd the dismal dome no cheerful breeze this sullen region knows the dreaded east is all the wind that blows here in a grotto shelterd close from air and screend in shades from days detested glare she sighs for ever on her pensive bed pain at her side and megrim at her head  two handmaids wait the throne alike in place but diffring far in figure and in face here stood ill nature like an ancient maid her wrinkled form in black and white arrayd with store of prayrs for mornings nights and noons her hand is filld her bosom with lampoons  there affectation with a sickly mien shows in her cheek the roses of eighteen practisd to lisp and hang the head aside faints into airs and languishes with pride on the rich quilt sinks with becoming woe wrappd in a gown for sickness and for show the fair ones feel such maladies as these when each new nightdress gives a new disease  a constant vapour oer the palace flies strange phantoms rising as the mists arise dreadful as hermits dreams in haunted shades or bright as visions of expiring maids now glaring fiends and snakes on rolling spires pale spectres gaping tombs and purple fires now lakes of liquid gold elysian scenes and crystal domes and angels in machines  unnumberd throngs on evry side are seen of bodies changd to various forms by spleen here living teapots stand one arm held out one bent the handle this and that the spout a pipkin there like homers tripod walks here sighs a jar and there a goose pie talks men prove with child as powrful fancy works and maids turnd bottles call aloud for corks  safe passd the gnome through this fantastic band a branch of healing spleenwort in his hand then thus addressd the powr hail wayward queen who rule the sex to fifty from fifteen parent of vapours and of female wit who give th hysteric or poetic fit on various tempers act by various ways make some take physic others scribble plays who cause the proud their visits to delay and send the godly in a pet to pray a nymph there is that all thy powr disdains and thousands more in equal mirth maintains but oh if eer thy gnome could spoil a grace or raise a pimple on a beauteous face like citron waters matrons cheeks inflame or change complexions at a losing game if eer with airy horns i planted heads or rumpled petticoats or tumbled beds or causd suspicion when no soul was rude or discomposd the headdress of a prude or eer to costive lapdog gave disease which not the tears of brightest eyes could ease hear me and touch belinda with chagrin that single act gives half the world the spleen  the goddess with a discontented air seems to reject him though she grants his prayr a wondrous bag with both her hands she binds like that where once ulysses held the winds there she collects the force of female lungs sighs sobs and passions and the war of tongues a vial next she fills with fainting fears soft sorrows melting griefs and flowing tears the gnome rejoicing bears her gifts away spreads his black wings and slowly mounts to day  sunk in thalestris arms the nymph he found her eyes dejected and her hair unbound full oer their heads the swelling bag he rent and all the furies issud at the vent belinda burns with more than mortal ire and fierce thalestris fans the rising fire oh wretched maid she spread her hands and cried while hamptons echoes wretched maid replied was it for this you took such constant care the bodkin comb and essence to prepare for this your locks in paper durance bound for this with tortring irons wreathd around for this with fillets straind your tender head and bravely bore the double loads of lead gods shall the ravisher display your hair while the fops envy and the ladies stare honour forbid at whose unrivalld shrine ease pleasure virtue all our sex resign methinks already i your tears survey already hear the horrid things they say already see you a degraded toast and all your honour in a whisper lost how shall i then your helpless fame defend twill then be infamy to seem your friend and shall this prize th inestimable prize exposd through crystal to the gazing eyes and heightend by the diamonds circling rays on that rapacious hand for ever blaze sooner shall grass in hyde park circus grow and wits take lodgings in the sound of bow sooner let earth air sea to chaos fall men monkeys lapdogs parrots perish all  she said then raging to sir plume repairs and bids her beau demand the precious hairs sir plume of amber snuffbox justly vain and the nice conduct of a clouded cane with earnest eyes and round unthinking face he first the snuffbox opend then the case and thus broke outmy lord why what the devil zds damn the lock fore gad you must be civil plague ont tis past a jestnay prithee pox give her the hairhe spoke and rappd his box  it grieves me much replied the peer again who speaks so well should ever speak in vain but by this lock this sacred lock i swear which never more shall join its parted hair which never more its honours shall renew clippd from the lovely head where late it grew that while my nostrils draw the vital air this hand which won it shall for ever wear he spoke and speaking in proud triumph spread the longcontended honours of her head  but umbriel hateful gnome forbears not so he breaks the vial whence the sorrows flow then see the nymph in beauteous grief appears her eyes halflanguishing halfdrownd in tears on her heavd bosom hung her drooping head which with a sigh she raisd and thus she said  for ever cursd be this detested day which snatchd my best my favrite curl away happy ah ten times happy had i been if hampton court these eyes had never seen yet am not i the first mistaken maid by love of courts to numrous ills betrayd oh had i rather unadmird remaind in some lone isle or distant northern land where the gilt chariot never marks the way where none learn ombre none eer taste bohea there kept my charms conceald from mortal eye like roses that in deserts bloom and die what movd my mind with youthful lords to roam oh had i stayd and said my prayrs at home twas this the morning omens seemd to tell thrice from my trembling hand the patchbox fell the tottring china shook without a wind nay poll sat mute and shock was most unkind a sylph too warnd me of the threats of fate in mystic visions now believd too late see the poor remnants of these slighted hairs my hands shall rend what evn thy rapine spares these in two sable ringlets taught to break once gave new beauties to the snowy neck the sisterlock now sits uncouth alone and in its fellows fate foresees its own uncurld it hangs the fatal shears demands and tempts once more thy sacrilegious hands oh hadst thou cruel been content to seize hairs less in sight or any hairs but these ,33,1688,1744,1
693,693,Alexander Pope,she said the pitying audience melt in tears  but fate and jove had stoppd the barons ears in vain thalestris with reproach assails for who can move when fair belinda fails not half so fixd the trojan could remain while anna beggd and dido ragd in vain then grave clarissa graceful wavd her fan silence ensud and thus the nymph began say why are beauties praisd and honourd most the wise mans passion and the vain mans toast why deckd with all that land and sea afford why angels calld and angellike adord why round our coaches crowd the whiteglovd beaux why bows the sidebox from its inmost rows how vain are all these glories all our pains unless good sense preserve what beauty gains that men may say when we the frontbox grace behold the first in virtue as in face oh if to dance all night and dress all day charmd the smallpox or chasd old age away who would not scorn what housewifes cares produce or who would learn one earthly thing of use to patch nay ogle might become a saint nor could it sure be such a sin to paint but since alas frail beauty must decay curld or uncurld since locks will turn to grey since painted or not painted all shall fade and she who scorns a man must die a maid what then remains but well our powr to use and keep good humour still whateer we lose and trust me dear good humour can prevail when airs and flights and screams and scolding fail beauties in vain their pretty eyes may roll charms strike the sight but merit wins the soul  so spoke the dame but no applause ensud belinda frownd thalestris calld her prude to arms to arms the fierce virago cries and swift as lightning to the combat flies all side in parties and begin th attack fans clap silks rustle and tough whalebones crack heroes and heroines shouts confusdly rise and bass and treble voices strike the skies no common weapons in their hands are found like gods they fight nor dread a mortal wound  so when bold homer makes the gods engage and heavnly breasts with human passions rage gainst pallas mars latona hermes arms and all olympus rings with loud alarms joves thunder roars heavn trembles all around blue neptune storms the bellowing deeps resound earth shakes her nodding towrs the ground gives way and the pale ghosts start at the flash of day  triumphant umbriel on a sconces height clappd his glad wings and sate to view the fight proppd on their bodkin spears the sprites survey the growing combat or assist the fray  while through the press enragd thalestris flies and scatters death around from both her eyes a beau and witling perishd in the throng one died in metaphor and one in song o cruel nymph a living death i bear cried dapperwit and sunk beside his chair a mournful glance sir fopling upwards cast those eyes are made so killingwas his last thus on meanders flowry margin lies th expiring swan and as he sings he dies  when bold sir plume had drawn clarissa down chloe steppd in and killd him with a frown she smild to see the doughty hero slain but at her smile the beau revivd again  now jove suspends his golden scales in air weighs the mens wits against the ladys hair the doubtful beam long nods from side to side at length the wits mount up the hairs subside  see fierce belinda on the baron flies with more than usual lightning in her eyes nor feard the chief th unequal fight to try who sought no more than on his foe to die but this bold lord with manly strength endud she with one finger and a thumb subdud just where the breath of life his nostrils drew a charge of snuff the wily virgin threw the gnomes direct to evry atom just the pungent grains of titillating dust sudden with starting tears each eye oerflows and the high dome reechoes to his nose  now meet thy fate incensd belinda cried and drew a deadly bodkin from her side the same his ancient personage to deck her great great grandsire wore about his neck in three sealrings which after melted down formd a vast buckle for his widows gown her infant grandames whistle next it grew the bells she jingled and the whistle blew then in a bodkin gracd her mothers hairs which long she wore and now belinda wears  boast not my fall he cried insulting foe thou by some other shalt be laid as low nor think to die dejects my lofty mind all that i dread is leaving you benind rather than so ah let me still survive and burn in cupids flamesbut burn alive   restore the lock she cries and all around restore the lock the vaulted roofs rebound not fierce othello in so loud a strain roard for the handkerchief that causd his pain but see how oft ambitious aims are crossd the chiefs contend till all the prize is lost the lock obtaind with guilt and kept with pain in evry place is sought but sought in vain with such a prize no mortal must be blest so heavn decrees with heavn who can contest   some thought it mounted to the lunar sphere since all things lost on earth are treasurd there there heros wits are kept in pondrous vases and beaux in snuff boxes and tweezercases there broken vows and deathbed alms are found and lovers hearts with ends of riband bound the courtiers promises and sick mans prayers the smiles of harlots and the tears of heirs cages for gnats and chains to yoke a flea dried butterflies and tomes of casuistry   but trust the museshe saw it upward rise though markd by none but quick poetic eyes so romes great founder to the heavns withdrew to proculus alone confessd in view a sudden star it shot through liquid air and drew behind a radiant trail of hair not berenices locks first rose so bright the heavns bespangling with dishevelld light the sylphs behold it kindling as it flies and pleasd pursue its progress through the skies   this the beau monde shall from the mall survey and hail with music its propitious ray this the blest lover shall for venus take and send up vows from rosamondas lake this partridge soon shall view in cloudless skies when next he looks through galileos eyes and hence th egregious wizard shall foredoom the fate of louis and the fall of rome   then cease bright nymph to mourn thy ravishd hair which adds new glory to the shining sphere not all the tresses that fair head can boast shall draw such envy as the lock you lost for after all the murders of your eye when after millions slain yourself shall die when those fair suns shall set as set they must and all those tresses shall be laid in dust this lock the muse shall consecrate to fame and midst the stars inscribe belindas name ,33,1688,1744,1

698,698,Edward Taylor,i sit on the tracks a hundred feet from earth fifty from the water gerald is inching toward me as grim slow and determined as a season because he has no trade and wants none its been nine months since i last listened to his fate but i know what he will say hes the fire hydrant of the underdog  when he reaches my point above the creek he sits down without salutation and spits profoundly out past the edge and peeks for meaning in the ripple it brings he scowls he speaks when you walk down any street you see nothing but coagulations of shit and vomit and im sick of it i suggest suicide he prefers murder and spits again for the sake of all the great devout losers  a conductors horn concerto breaks the air and we two doomed pennies on the track shove off and somersault like anesthetized fleas ruffling the ideal locomotive poised on the water with our light dry bodies gerald shouts terrifically as he sails downstream like a young man with a destination i swim toward shore as fast as my boots will allow as always neglecting to drown,23,1642,1729,1
699,699,Edward Taylor,jim just loves to garden yes he does  he likes nothing better than to put on  his little overalls and his straw hat  he says lets go get those tools jim  but then doubt begins to set in he says what is a garden anyway and thoughts about a modernistic garden begin to trouble him eat away at his resolve  he stands in the driveway a long time  horticulture is a groping in the dark  into the obscure and unfamiliar  kneeling before a disinterested secret  slapping it punching it like a chinese puzzle birdbrained babbling gibberish dig and destroy pull out and apply salt  hoe and spray before it spreads burn roots  where not desired with gloved hands poisonous  the selfsacrifice of it the selflove  into the interior thunderclap excruciating  through the nose the earsplitting necrology  of it the withering shrivelling  the handy hose holder and persian insect powder  and smut fungi the enemies of the iris  wireworms are worse than their parents  there is no way out flowers as big as heads  pockmarked disfigured blinking insolently  at me the me who so loves to garden  because it prevents the heaving of the ground  and the untimely death of porch furniture  and dark murky days in a large city  and the dream home under a permanent storm  is also a factor to keep in mind,23,1642,1729,1
700,700,Edward Taylor,it seemed as if the enormous journey  was finally approaching its conclusion from the window of the train the last trees were dissipating a childlike sailor waved once a seallike dog barked and died the conductor entered the lavatory  and was not seen again although  his harmonicaplaying was appreciated  he was not without talent some said a botanist with whom i had become acquainted actually suggested we form a group or something i was looking for a familiar signpost in his face or a landmark that would indicate the true colors of his tribe but alas there was not a glass of water  anywhere or even the remains of a trail  i got a bewildered expression of my own  and slinked to the back of the car  where a nun started to tickle me  she confided to me that it was her cowboy pride that got her through    through what i thought but drew my hand close to my imaginary vest thats a beautiful vest she said as i began crawling down the aisle at last i pressed my face against  the window a little fog was licking its chop as was the stationmaster  licking something we didnt stop we didnt appear to be arriving and yet we were almost out of landscape no creeks or rivers nothing even remotely reminding one of a mound o mound thou aint around no more a heap of abstract geometrical symbols thats what its coming to i thought a nothing you could sink your teeth into reliefs on the way a little knownothing boy said to me imagine my surprise i said and reached out to muss his hair but he had no hair and it felt unlucky touching his skull like that forget what i said he said what did you say i asked in automatic compliance and then it got very dark and quiet i closed my eyes and dreamed of an emu i once loved,23,1642,1729,1
701,701,Edward Taylor,the directions to the lunatic asylum were confusing more likely they were the random associations and confused ramblings of a lunatic we arrived three hours late for lunch and the lunatics were stacked up on their shelves quite neatly i might add giving credit where credit is due the orderlies were clearly very orderly and they should receive all the credit that is their due when i asked one of the doctors for a corkscrew he produced one without a moments hesitation and it was a corkscrew of the finest craftsmanship very shiny and bright not unlike the doctor himself well be conducting our picnic under the great oak beginning in just a few minutes and if youd care to join us wed be most honored however i understand you have your obligations and responsibilities and if you would prefer to simply visit with us from time to time between patients our invitation is nothing if not flexible and we shant be the least slighted or offended in any way if due to your heavy load we are altogether deprived of the pleasure of exchanging a few anecdotes regarding the mentally ill depraved diseased the purely knavish you in your bughouse if youll pardon my vernacular o yes and we in our crackbrain daily rounds there are so many gone potty everywhere we roam not to mention in ones own home dead moonstruck well well indeed we would have many notes to compare if you could find the time to join us after your injections my invitation was spoken in the evenest tones but midway though it i began to suspect i was addressing an imposter i returned the corkscrew in a nonthreatening manner what for instance i asked myself would a doctor a doctor of the mind be doing with a cordscrew in his pocket this was a very sick man one might even say dangerous i began moving away cautiously never taking my eyes off of him his right eyelid was twitching guiltily or at least anxiously and his smock flapping slightly in the wind several members of our party were mingling with the nurses down by the duck pond and my grip on the situation was loosening the planks in my picnic platform were rotting i was thinking about the potato salad in an unstable environment a weeping spell was about to overtake me i was very close to howling and gnashing the gladiola i noticed the great calm of the clouds overhead and below several nurses appeared to me in need of nursing the psychopaths were stirring from their naps i should say their postprandial slumbers they were lumbering through the pines like inordinately sad moose who could eat liverwurst at a time like this but then again whats a picnic without pathos lacking a way home i adjusted the flap in my head and duckwalked down to the pond and into the pond and began gliding around in circles quacking quacking like a scarf inside the belly of that image i began recycling like a sorry whim sincerest regrets are always best,23,1642,1729,1
702,702,Edward Taylor,she has one good bumblebee which she leads about town on a leash of clover its as big as a saint bernard but also extremely fragile people want to pet its long shaggy coat these would be mostly whirling dervishes out shopping for accessories when lily winks they understand everything right down to the particle of a butterflys wing lodged in her last good eye so the situation is avoided the potential for a cataclysm is narrowly averted and the bumblebee lugs its little bundle of shaved nerves forward on a mission from some sick young godhead,23,1642,1729,1
703,703,Edward Taylor,the new ergonomics were delivered  just before lunchtime  so we ignored them without revealing the particulars  let me just say that  lunch was most satisfying  jack and roberta went with  the corned beef for a change  jack believes in alien abduction  and roberta does not  although she has had  several lost weekends lately  and one or two unexplained scars  on her buttocks i thought  i recognized someone from my childhood  at a table across the room  the same teeth the same hair  but when he stoodup i wasnt sure squid with a red tie  impossible i finished  my quiche lorraine  and returned my thoughts  to jacks new jag well i guess anythings  possible people disappear  all the time and most of them  have no explanation when and if they return  look at tonys daughter  and shes never been the same jack was looking as if  hed bet on the right horse now and these new ergonomics  who really designed them does anybody know do they tell us anything a name an address hell no squid was paying his bill in a standardissue blue blazer  he looked across the room at me  several times he looked tired  like he wanted to sleep for a long time  in a barn somewhere in kansas  i wanted to sleep there too,23,1642,1729,1
704,704,Edward Taylor,the common is unusually calmthey captured the storm last night its sleeping in the stockade relieved of its duty pacified tamed a pussycat but not before it tied the flagpole in knots and not before it alarmed the firemen out of their pants now its really calm almost too calm as though anything could happen and it would be a first it could be the worst thing that ever happened all the little rodents are sitting up and counting their nuts what if nothing ever happened again would there be enough to eke out an existence as they say i wish they were here now kicking up a little dust mussing my hair taunting me with weird syllogisms instead these are the windless halcyon days the lull dispassion is upon us serenity has triumphed in its mindless atrophied way a school of stoics walks by eager in its phlegmatic way to observe human degradation lust and debauchery at close quarters they are disappointed but it barely shows on their faces they are late stoa very late they missed the bus they should have been here last night the joint was jumping but people change they grow up they fly around its the same old story but i dont remember it its a tale of gore and glory but we had to leave it could have turned out differently and it did i feel much the same way about the city of pompeii a police officer with a poodle cut squirts his gun at me for saying that and its still just barely possible that i didnt and the clock is running out on his sort of behavior im napping in a wigwam as i write this near amity street which is buried under fifteen feet of ashes and cinders and rocks moss and a certain herblike creature are beginning to whisper nearby i am beside myself peering down senselessly since for us in space there is neither above nor below and thus the expression he is being nibbled to death by ducks shines with such style such poise and reserve a beautiful puissant form and a lucid thought to which i reply it is time we had our teeth examined by a dentist so said james the lesser to james the more,23,1642,1729,1
705,705,Edward Taylor,my felisberto is handsomer than your mergotroid although admittedly your mergotroid may be the wiser of the two  whereas your mergotroid never winces or quails  my felisberto is a titan of inconsistencies for a night of wit and danger and temptation  my felisberto would be the obvious choice however at dawn or dusk when serenity is desired  your mergotroid cannot be ignored merely to sit near it in the garden and watch the fabrications of the world swirl by  the deepseas bathymetry wash your eyes  not to mention the little fawns of the forest  and their flipfloppy gymnastics ah for this  and so much more your mergotroid is infinitely preferable  but there is a place for darkness and obscurity  without which life can sometimes seem too much  too frivolous and too profound simultaneously  and that is when my felisberto is needed  is longed for and loved and then the sun can rise again  the bee and the hummingbird drink of the world  and your mergotroid elaborates the silent concert  that is always and always about to begin,23,1642,1729,1
706,706,Edward Taylor,i swerved to avoid hitting a squirrel in the center of the road and thats when the deer came charging out of the forest and forced me to hit the brakes for all i was worth and i careened back to the other side of the road just as a skunk came toddling out of mrs bancrofts front yard and i swung back perhaps just grazing it a bit i glanced quickly in the rearview mirror and in that instant a groundhog waddled from the side of the road and i zigzagged madly and dont know if i nipped it or not because up ahead i could see a coyote stalking the colliers cat oh well i said and drove the rest of the way home without incident,23,1642,1729,1
707,707,Edward Taylor,theres a fortune to be made in just about everything in this country somebodys father had to invent everythingbaby food tractors rat poisoning my familys obviously done nothing since the beginning of time they invented poverty and bad taste and getting by and taking it from the boss o my mother goes around chewing her nails and spitting them in a jar you shouldnt be ashamed of yourself she says think of your family my family i say what have they ever done but paint by numbers the most absurd and disgusting scenes of plastic squalor and human degradation well then think of your great great etc uncle patrick henry,23,1642,1729,1
708,708,Edward Taylor,the disorganization to which i currently belong has skipped several meetings in a row which is a pattern i find almost fatally attractive down at headquarters theres a secretary and a janitor who i shall call suzie and boy can she ever shoot straight shell shoot you straight in the eye if you ask her to i mow the grass every other saturday and thats the day she polishes the trivets whether they need it or not i dont know if there is a name for this kind of behavior hers or mine but somebody once said something or another thats why i joined up in the first place so somebody could teach me a few useful phrases such as good afternoon my dear analretentive doctor and my that is a lovely dictionary you have on mrs smith  still i hardly feel like functioning even on a brute or loutish level my plants think im one of them and they dont look so good themselves or so i tell them i like to give them at least several reasons to be annoyed with me its how they exercise their skinny spectrum of emotions because that and cribbage often when i return from the club late at night wearyladen wearywinged washed out i can actually hear the nematodes working sucking the juices from the living cells of my narcissus i have mentioned this to suzie on several occasions each time she has backed away from me panicstricken when really i was just making a stab at conversation it is not my intention to alarm anyone but dear lord if i find a dead man in the road and his eyes are crawling with maggots i refuse to say have a nice day suzie just because shes desperate and her life is a runaway carriage rushing toward a cliff now can i would you let her get away with that kind of crap who are you anyway and what kind of disorganization is this baron of the holy grail well its about time you got here i was worried i was starting to fret,23,1642,1729,1
709,709,Edward Taylor,napoleons hat is an obvious choice i guess to list as a famous hat but thats not the hat i have in mind that was his hat for show i am thinking of his private bathing cap which in all hon esty wasnt much different than the one any jerk might buy at a corner drugstore now except for two minor eccentricities the first one isnt even funny simply it was a white rubber bathing cap but too small napoleon led such a hectic life ever since his childhood even farther back than that that he never had a chance to buy a new bathing cap and still as a grownupwell he didnt really grow that much but his head did he was a pin head at birth and he used until his death really the same little tiny bathing cap that he was born in and this meant that later it was very painful to him and gave him many headaches as if he needed more so he had to vaseline his skull like crazy to even get the thing on the second eccentricity was that it was a tricorn bathing cap scholars like to make a lot out of this and it would be easy to do my theory is simpleminded to be sure that be neath his public head there was another head and it was a pyra mid or something,23,1642,1729,1
710,710,Edward Taylor,a motorist once said to me  and this was in the country  on a county lane a motorist  slowed his vehicle as i was  walking my dear old collie sithney by the side of the road  and the motorist came to a halt  mildly alarming both sithney and myself  not yet accustomed to automobiles  and this particular motorist  sent a little spasm of fright up our spines  which in turn panicked the driver a bit  and it seemed as if we were off to a bad start  and thats when sithney began to bark  and the man could not be heard that is  if he was speaking or trying to speak  because i was commanding sithnewy to be silent  though indeed i was sympathetic  to his emotional excitement it was as i recall a day of prodigious beauty  april  clouds like the inside of your head explained  bluebirds too numerous to mention  the clover calling you by name and fields oozing green and this motorist from nowhere  moving his lips like the wings of a butterfly  and nothing coming out  and sithney silent now  he was no longer looking at us  but straight ahead  where his election was in doubt thats a fine dog he said collies are made in heaven well if i were a voting man id vote for you i said a bedoozling day to be lost in the country i say leastways i am a misplaced individual we introduced ourselves and swapped a few stories he was a veteran and a salesmen who didnt believe in his product ive forgotten what it washair restorer parrot feedand he enjoyed nothing more then a a day spent meandering the back roads  in his jalopy i gave him directions  to the denton farm but i doubt  that he followed them he didnt  seem to be listening and it was getting late  and sithney had an idea of his own  and i dont know why i am remembering this now  just that he summed himself up by saying  ive missed too many boats  and all these years later i keep thinking that was a man  who loved to miss boats but he didnt miss them that much,23,1642,1729,1
711,711,Edward Taylor,jesus got up one day a little later than usual he had been dream ing so deep there was nothing left in his head what was it a nightmare dead bodies walking all around him eyes rolled back skin falling off but he wasnt afraid of that it was a beau tiful day  how bout some coffee dont mind if i do take a little ride on my donkey i love that donkey hell i love everybody,23,1642,1729,1
712,712,Edward Taylor,all night a door floated down the river it tried to remember little incidents of pleasure from its former life like the time the lovers leaned against it kissing for hours and whispering those famous words later there were harsh words and a shoe was thrown and the door was slammed comings and goings by the thousands the early mornings and late nights years years o theyve got big plans theyll make a bundle the door was an island that swayed in its sleep the moon turned the doorknob just slightly burned its fingers and ran and still the door said nothing and slept at least thats what they like to say the little fishes and so on far away a bell rang and then a shot was fired,23,1642,1729,1

714,714,Edward Taylor,for my father   your face did not rot like the othersthe copilot for example i saw him  yesterday his face is corn mush his wife and daughter the poor ignorant people stare  as if he will compose soon he was more wronged than job but your face did not rot  like the othersit grew dark and hard like ebony the features progressed in their  distinction if i could cajole you to come back for an evening down from your compulsive  orbiting i would touch you read your face as dallas your hoodlum gunner now  with the blistered eyes reads his braille editions i would touch your face as a disinterested  scholar touches an original page however frightening i would discover you and i would not  turn you in i would not make you face your wife or dallas or the copilot jim you  could return to your crazy orbiting and i would not try to fully understand what  it means to you all i know is this when i see you as i have seen you at least  once every year of my life spin across the wilds of the sky like a tiny african god  i feel dead i feel as if i were the residue of a strangers life that i should pursue you  my head cocked toward the sky i cannot get off the ground and you passing over again  fast perfect and unwilling to tell me that you are doing well or that it was mistake  that placed you in that world and me in this or that misfortune placed these worlds in us,23,1642,1729,1
715,715,Edward Taylor,speaking of sunsets last nights was shocking i mean sunsets arent supposed to frighten you are they well this one was terrifying sure it was beautiful but far too beautiful  it wasnt natural one climax followed another and then another until your knees went weak  and you couldnt breathe the colors were definitely not of this world peaches dripping opium pandemonium of tangerines inferno of irises plutonian emeralds all swirling and churning swabbing  like it was playing with us like we were nothing as if our whole lives were a preparation for this  this for which nothing could have prepared us  and for which we could not have been less prepared the mockery of it all stung us bitterly and when it was finally over we whimpered and cried and howled and then the streetlights came on as always  and we looked into one anothers eyes ancient caves with still pools and those little transparent fish who have never seen even one ray of light and the calm that returned to us was not even our own,23,1642,1729,1
716,716,Edward Taylor,the bear that breathes the northern blast did numb torpedolike a wasp whose stiffened limbs encramped lay bathing in sols warm breath and shine as saving which with her hands she chafes and stands rubbing her legs shanks thighs and hands her pretty toes and fingers ends nipped with this breath she out extends unto the sun in great desire to warm her digits at that fire doth hold her temples in this state where pulse doth beat and head doth ache doth turn and stretch her body small doth comb her velvet capital as if her little brain pan were a volume of choice precepts clear as if her satin jacket hot contained apothecarys shop of natures receipts that prevails to remedy all her sad ails as if her velvet helmet high did turret rationality she fans her wing up to the wind as if her pettycoat were lined with reasons fleece and hoists sails and humming flies in thankful gales unto her dun curled palace hall her warm thanks offering for all        lord clear my misted sight that i may hence view thy divinity some sparks whereof thou up dost hasp within this little downy wasp in whose small corporation we a school and a schoolmaster see where we may learn and easily find a nimble spirit bravely mind her work in every limb and lace it up neat with a vital grace acting each part though neer so small here of this fustian animal till i enravished climb into the godhead on this ladder do where all my pipes inspired upraise an heavenly music furred with praise,23,1642,1729,1
717,717,Edward Taylor,some people go their whole lives without ever writing a single poem extraordinary people who dont hesitate to cut somebodys heart or skull open they go to baseball games with the greatest of ease and play a few rounds of golf as if it were nothing these same people stroll into a church  as if that were a natural part of life  investing money is second nature to them  they contribute to political campaigns  that have absolutely no poetry in them  and promise none for the future they sit around the dinner table at night  and pretend as though nothing is missing  their children get caught shoplifting at the mall  and no one admits that it is poetry they are missing  the family dog howls all night  lonely and starving for more poetry in his life  why is it so difficult for them to see that without poetry their lives are effluvial sure they have their banquets their celebrations  croquet fox hunts their sea shores and sunsets  their cocktails on the balcony dog races and all that kissing and hugging and dont  forget the good deeds the charity work  nursing the baby squirrels all through the night filling the birdfeeders all winter helping the stranger change her tire still theres that disagreeable exhalation from decaying matter subtle but everpresent they walk around erect like champions they are smoothspoken and witty when alone rare occasion they stare into the mirror for hours bewildered there was something they meant to say but didnt  and if we put the statue of the rhinoceros next to the tweezers and walk around the room three times learn to yodel shave our heads call  our ancestors back from the dead  poetrywise its still a bust bankrupt you havent scribbled a syllable of it youre a nowhere man misfiring the very essence of your life flustering nothing from nothing and back again the hereafter may not last all that long radiant childhood sweetheart secret code of everlasting joy and sorrow  fanciful pen strokes beneath the eyelids all day all night meditation knot of hope kernel of desire pure ordinariness of life  seeking through poetry a benediction or a bed to lie down on to connect reveal explore to imbue meaning on the days extravagant labor  and yet its cruel to expect too much  its a rare species of bird  that refuses to be categorized its song is barely audible it is like a dragonfly in a dream here then there then here again lowflying amberwing darting upward then out of sight and the dream has a pain in its heart the wonders of which are manifold or so the story is told,23,1642,1729,1
718,718,Edward Taylor,they ask me if ive ever thought about the end of the world and i say come in come in let me give you some lunch for gods sake after a few bites its the afterlife they want to talk about ouch i say did you see that grape leaf skeletonizer then theyre talking about redemption and the chosen few sitting right by his side doing what i ask just sitting i am surrounded by burned up zombies lets have some lemon chiffon pie i bought yesterday at the  dog bakery but they want to talk about my soul im getting drowsy and see butterflies everywhere would you gentlemen like to take a nap i know i would they stand and back away from me out the door walking toward my neighbors a black cloud over their heads and they see nothing without end,23,1642,1729,1
719,719,Edward Taylor,after the burial  we returned to our units  and assumed our poses  our posture was the new posture  and not the old sick posture  when we left our stations  it was just to prove we could  not a serious departure  or a search for yet another beginning  we were done with all that we were settled in as they say  though it might have been otherwise  what a story after the burial we returned to our units  and here is where i am experiencing  that lag kicking syndrome thing  my leg for no apparent reason flies around the room kicking stuff  well whatever is in its way  like a screen or a watering can those are just two examples and indeed i could give many more i could construct a catalogue  of the things it kicks  perhaps i will do that later well just have to see if its really wanted  or i could do a little now  and then return to listing later it kicked the scrimshaw collection  yes it did it kicked the ocelot  which was rude and uncalled for and yes hurtful it kicked  the guacamole right out of its bowl  which made for a grubby  and potentially dangerous workplace  i was out testing the new speed bump  when it kicked the viscountess  which she probably deserved  and i was happy needless to say  to not be a witness the kicking subsided for a while  nobody was keeping track of time  at that time so it is impossible  to fill out the forms accurately  suffice it to say we remained at our units on constant alert and then it kicked over the little cow town we had set up for punching and that sort of thing  a covered wagon filled with cover girls but now it was kicked over  and we had a moment of silence  but it was clear to me  that many of our minions  were getting tetchy  and some of them were getting tetchier and then it kicked a particularly treasured snuff box  which legend has it once belonged to somebody  named bob mackey so we were understandably  saddened and returned to our units rather weary  no one seemed to think i was in the least bit culpable  it was my leg of course that was doing the actual kicking  of that i am almost certain at any rate we decided to bury it after the burial we returned to our units  and assumed our poses a little bit of time passed not much  and then johns leg started acting suspicious  it looked like it wanted to kick the replica  of the white house we keep on hand  just for situations such as this and then sure enough it did,23,1642,1729,1
720,720,Edward Taylor,this is the hardest part when i came back to life i was a good family dog and not too friendly to strangers i got a thirtyfive dollar raise in salary and through the peasoup fogs  i drove the general and introduced him  at rallies i had a totalitarian approach  and was a massive boost to his popularity  i did my best to reduce the number of people  the local bourgeoisie did not exist one of them was a mystic  and walked right over me  as if i were a bed of hot coals this is par for the course i will be employing sundry golf metaphors  henceforth because a dog best friend  and chief advisor to the general should  while dining with the general i said lets play the back nine in a sacred rage  lets teeoff over the foredoomed community  and putt ourselves thunderously touching bottom  he drank it all in rugged and dusky i think i know what he was thinking  he held his automatic to my little head  and recited a poem about my many weaknesses  for which i loved him so,23,1642,1729,1

723,723,Oliver Goldsmith,when lovely woman stoops to folly and finds too late that men betray what charm can soothe her melancholy what art can wash her guilt away  the only art her guilt to cover to hide her shame from every eye to give repentance to her lover and wring his bosom isto die,4,1730,1774,1
724,724,Oliver Goldsmith,good people all with one accord lament for madam blaize who never wanted a good word  from those who spoke her praise  the needy seldom passed her door and always found her kind she freely lent to all the poor  who left a pledge behind  she strove the neighbourhood to please with manners wondrous winning and never followed wicked ways  unless when she was sinning  at church in silks and satins new with hoop of monstrous size she never slumbered in her pew  but when she shut her eyes  her love was sought i do aver by twenty beaux and more the king himself has followed her  when she has walked before  but now her wealth and finery fled her hangerson cut short all the doctors found when she was dead  her last disorder mortal  let us lament in sorrow sore for kent street well may say that had she lived a twelvemonth more  she had not died today,4,1730,1774,1
725,725,Oliver Goldsmith,sweet auburn loveliest village of the plain where health and plenty cheered the labouring swain where smiling spring its earliest visits paid and parting summers lingering blooms delayed dear lovely bowers of innocence and ease seats of my youth where every sport could please how often have i loitered oer your green where humble happiness endeared each scene how often have i paused on every charm the sheltered cot the cultivated farm the neverfailing brook the busy mill the decent church that topped the neighbouring hill the hawthorn bush with seats beneath the shade for talking age and whispering lovers made how often have i blessed the coming day when toil remitting lent its turn to play and all the village train from labour free led up their sports beneath the spreading tree while many a pastime circled in the shade the young contending as the old surveyed and many a gambol frolicked oer the ground and sleights of art and feats of strength went round and still as each repeated pleasure tired succeeding sports the mirthful band inspired the dancing pair that simply sought renown by holding out to tire each other down the swain mistrustless of his smutted face while secret laughter tittered round the place the bashful virgins sidelong look of love the matrons glance that would those looks reprove these were thy charms sweet village sports like these with sweet succession taught even toil to please these round thy bowers their cheerful influence shed these were thy charmsbut all these charms are fled  sweet smiling village loveliest of the lawn thy sports are fled and all thy charms withdrawn amidst thy bowers the tyrants hand is seen and desolation saddens all thy green one only master grasps the whole domain and half a tillage stints thy smiling plain no more thy glassy brook reflects the day but choked with sedges works its weedy way along thy glades a solitary guest the hollowsounding bittern guards its nest amidst thy desert walks the lapwing flies and tires their echoes with unvaried cries sunk are thy bowers in shapeless ruin all and the long grass oertops the mouldering wall and trembling shrinking from the spoilers hand far far away thy children leave the land  ill fares the land to hastening ills a prey where wealth accumulates and men decay princes and lords may flourish or may fade a breath can make them as a breath has made but a bold peasantry their countrys pride when once destroyed can never be supplied  a time there was ere englands griefs began when every rood of ground maintained its man for him light labour spread her wholesome store just gave what life required but gave no more his best companions innocence and health and his best riches ignorance of wealth  but times are altered trades unfeeling train usurp the land and dispossess the swain along the lawn where scattered hamlets rose unwieldy wealth and cumbrous pomp repose and every want to opulence allied and every pang that folly pays to pride those gentle hours that plenty bade to bloom those calm desires that asked but little room those healthful sports that graced the peaceful scene lived in each look and brightened all the green these far departing seek a kinder shore and rural mirth and manners are no more  sweet auburn parent of the blissful hour thy glades forlorn confess the tyrants power here as i take my solitary rounds amidst thy tangling walks and ruined grounds and many a year elapsed return to view where once the cottage stood the hawthorn grew remembrance wakes with all her busy train swells at my breast and turns the past to pain  in all my wanderings round this world of care in all my griefsand god has given my share  i still had hopes my latest hours to crown amidst these humble bowers to lay me down to husband out lifes taper at the close and keep the flame from wasting by repose i still had hopes for pride attends us still amidst the swains to show my booklearned skill around my fire an evening group to draw and tell of all i felt and all i saw and as a hare whom hounds and horns pursue pants to the place from whence at first she flew i still had hopes my long vexations passed here to returnand die at home at last  o blest retirement friend to lifes decline retreats from care that never must be mine how happy he who crowns in shades like these a youth of labour with an age of ease who quits a world where strong temptations try and since tis hard to combat learns to fly for him no wretches born to work and weep explore the mine or tempt the dangerous deep no surly porter stands in guilty state to spurn imploring famine from the gate but on he moves to meet his latter end angels round befriending virtues friend bends to the grave with unperceived decay while resignation gently slopes the way all all his prospects brightening to the last his heaven commences ere the world be past  sweet was the sound when oft at evenings close up yonder hill the village murmur rose there as i passed with careless steps and slow the mingling notes came softened from below the swain responsive as the milkmaid sung the sober herd that lowed to meet their young the noisy geese that gabbled oer the pool the playful children just let loose from school the watchdogs voice that bayed the whispring wind and the loud laugh that spoke the vacant mind these all in sweet confusion sought the shade and filled each pause the nightingale had made but now the sounds of population fail no cheerful murmurs fluctuate in the gale no busy steps the grassgrown footway tread for all the bloomy flush of life is fled all but yon widowed solitary thing that feebly bends beside the plashy spring she wretched matron forced in age for bread to strip the brook with mantling cresses spread to pick her wintry faggot from the thorn to seek her nightly shed and weep till morn she only left of all the harmless train the sad historian of the pensive plain  near yonder copse where once the garden smiled and still where many a garden flower grows wild there where a few torn shrubs the place disclose the village preachers modest mansion rose a man he was to all the country dear and passing rich with forty pounds a year remote from towns he ran his godly race nor eer had changed nor wished to change his place unpractised he to fawn or seek for power by doctrines fashioned to the varying hour far other aims his heart had learned to prize more skilled to raise the wretched than to rise his house was known to all the vagrant train he chid their wanderings but relieved their pain the long remembered beggar was his guest whose beard descending swept his aged breast the ruined spendthrift now no longer proud claimed kindred there and had his claims allowed the broken soldier kindly bade to stay sat by his fire and talked the night away wept oer his wounds or tales of sorrow done shouldered his crutch and showed how fields were won pleased with his guests the good man learned to glow and quite forgot their vices in their woe careless their merits or their faults to scan his pity gave ere charity began  thus to relieve the wretched was his pride and een his failings leaned to virtues side but in his duty prompt at every call he watched and wept he prayed and felt for all and as a bird each fond endearment tries to tempt its newfledged offspring to the skies he tried each art reproved each dull delay allured to brighter worlds and led the way  beside the bed where parting life was laid and sorrow guilt and pain by turns dismayed the reverend champion stood at his control despair and anguish fled the struggling soul comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise and his last faltering accents whispered praise  at church with meek and unaffected grace his looks adorned the venerable place truth from his lips prevailed with double sway and fools who came to scoff remained to pray the service passed around the pious man with steady zeal each honest rustic ran even children followed with endearing wile and plucked his gown to share the good mans smile his ready smile a parents warmth expressed their welfare pleased him and their cares distressed to them his heart his love his griefs were given but all his serious thoughts had rest in heaven as some tall cliff that lifts its awful form swells from the vale and midway leaves the storm though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread eternal sunshine settles on its head  beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way with blossomed furze unprofitably gay there in his noisy mansion skilled to rule the village master taught his little school a man severe he was and stern to view i knew him well and every truant knew well had the boding tremblers learned to trace the days disasters in his morning face full well they laughed with counterfeited glee at all his jokes for many a joke had he full well the busy whisper circling round conveyed the dismal tidings when he frowned yet he was kind or if severe in aught the love he bore to learning was in fault the village all declared how much he knew twas certain he could write and cipher too lands he could measure terms and tides presage and even the story ran that he could gauge in arguing too the parson owned his skill for een though vanquished he could argue still while words of learned length and thundering sound amazed the gazing rustics ranged around and still they gazed and still the wonder grew that one small head could carry all he knew  but past is all his fame the very spot where many a time he triumphed is forgot near yonder thorn that lifts its head on high where once the signpost caught the passing eye low lies that house where nutbrown draughts inspired where greybeard mirth and smiling toil retired where village statesmen talked with looks profound and news much older than their ale went round imagination fondly stoops to trace the parlour splendours of that festive place the whitewashed wall the nicely sanded floor the varnished clock that clicked behind the door the chest contrived a double debt to pay  a bed by night a chest of drawers by day the pictures placed for ornament and use the twelve good rules the royal game of goose the hearth except when winter chilled the day with aspen boughs and flowers and fennel gay while broken teacups wisely kept for show ranged oer the chimney glistened in a row  vain transitory splendours could not all reprieve the tottering mansion from its fall obscure it sinks nor shall it more impart an hours importance to the poor mans heart thither no more the peasant shall repair to sweet oblivion of his daily care no more the farmers news the barbers tale no more the woodmans ballad shall prevail no more the smith his dusky brow shall clear relax his ponderous strength and lean to hear the host himself no longer shall be found careful to see the mantling bliss go round nor the coy maid half willing to be pressed shall kiss the cup to pass it to the rest  yes let the rich deride the proud disdain these simple blessings of the lowly train to me more dear congenial to my heart one native charm than all the gloss of art spontaneous joys where nature has its play the soul adopts and owns their firstborn sway lightly they frolic oer the vacant mind unenvied unmolested unconfined but the long pomp the midnight masquerade with all the freaks of wanton wealth arrayed in these ere triflers half their wish obtain the toiling pleasure sickens into pain and even while fashions brightest arts decoy the heart distrusting asks if this be joy  ye friends to truth ye statesmen who survey the rich mans joys increase the poors decay tis yours to judge how wide the limits stand between a splendid and a happy land proud swells the tide with loads of freighted ore and shouting folly hails them from her shore hoards even beyond the misers wish abound and rich men flock from all the world around yet count our gains this wealth is but a name that leaves our useful products still the same not so the loss the man of wealth and pride takes up a space that many poor supplied space for his lake his parks extended bounds space for his horses equipage and hounds the robe that wraps his limbs in silken sloth has robbed the neighbouring fields of half their growth his seat where solitary sports are seen indignant spurns the cottage from the green around the world each needful product flies for all the luxuries the world supplies while thus the land adorned for pleasure all in barren splendour feebly waits the fall  as some fair female unadorned and plain secure to please while youth confirms her reign slights every borrowed charm that dress supplies nor shares with art the triumph of her eyes but when those charms are passed for charms are frail when time advances and when lovers fail she then shines forth solicitous to bless in all the glaring impotence of dress thus fares the land by luxury betrayed in natures simplest charms at first arrayed but verging to decline its splendours rise its vistas strike its palaces surprise while scourged by famine from the smiling land the mournful peasant leads his humble band and while he sinks without one arm to save the country bloomsa garden and a grave  where then ah where shall poverty reside to scape the pressure of contiguous pride if to some commons fenceless limits strayed he drives his flock to pick the scanty blade those fenceless fields the sons of wealth divide and even the bareworn common is denied if to the city spedwhat waits him there to see profusion that he must not share to see ten thousand baneful arts combined to pamper luxury and thin mankind to see those joys the sons of pleasure know extorted from his fellow creatures woe here while the courtier glitters in brocade there the pale artist plies the sickly trade here while the proud their longdrawn pomps display there the black gibbet glooms beside the way the dome where pleasure holds her midnight reign here richly decked admits the gorgeous train tumultuous grandeur crowds the blazing square the rattling chariots clash the torches glare sure scenes like these no troubles eer annoy sure these denote one universal joy are these thy serious thoughtsah turn thine eyes where the poor houseless shivering female lies she once perhaps in a village plenty blessed has wept at tales of innocence distressed her modest looks the cottage might adorn sweet as the primrose peeps beneath the thorn now lost to all her friends her virtue fled near her betrayers door she lays her head and pinched with cold and shrinking from the shower with heavy heart deplores that luckless hour when idly first ambitious of the town she left her wheel and robes of country brown  do thine sweet auburn thine the loveliest train do thy fair tribes participate her pain een now perhaps by cold and hunger led at proud mens doors they ask a little bread  ah noto distant climes a dreary scene where half the convex world intrudes between through torrid tracts with fainting steps they go where wild altama murmurs to their woe far different there from all that charmed before the various terrors of that horrid shore those blazing suns that dart a downward ray and fiercely shed intolerable day those matted woods where birds forget to sing but silent bats in drowsy clusters cling those poisonous fields with rank luxuriance crowned where the dark scorpion gathers death around where at each step the stranger fears to wake the rattling terrors of the vengeful snake where crouching tigers wait their hapless prey and savage men more murderous still than they while oft in whirls the mad tornado flies mingling the ravaged landscape with the skies far different these from every former scene the cooling brook the grassyvested green the breezy covert of the warbling grove that only sheltered thefts of harmless love  good heaven what sorrows gloomed that parting day that called them from their native walks away when the poor exiles every pleasure passed hung round their bowers and fondly looked their last and took a long farewell and wished in vain for seats like these beyond the western main and shuddering still to face the distant deep returned and wept and still returned to weep the good old sire the first prepared to go to newfound worlds and wept for others woe but for himself in conscious virtue brave he only wished for worlds beyond the grave his lovely daughter lovelier in her tears the fond companion of his helpless years silent went next neglectful of her charms and left a lovers for a fathers arms with louder plaints the mother spoke her woes and blessed the cot where every pleasure rose and kissed her thoughtless babes with many a tear and clasped them close in sorrow doubly dear whilst her fond husband strove to lend relief in all the silent manliness of grief  o luxury thou cursed by heavens decree how ill exchanged are things like these for thee how do thy potions with insidious joy diffuse thy pleasures only to destroy kingdoms by thee to sickly greatness grown boast of a florid vigour not their own at every draught more large and large they grow a bloated mass of rank unwieldly woe till sapped their strength and every part unsound down down they sink and spread the ruin round  even now the devastation is begun and half the business of destruction done even now methinks as pondering here i stand i see the rural virtues leave the land down where yon anchoring vessel spreads the sail that idly waiting flaps with every gale downward they move a melancholy band pass from the shore and darken all the strand contented toil and hospitable care and kind connubial tenderness are there and piety with wishes placed above and steady loyalty and faithful love and thou sweet poetry thou loveliest maid still first to fly where sensual joys invade unfit in these degenerate times of shame to catch the heart or strike for honest fame dear charming nymph neglected and decried my shame in crowds my solitary pride thou source of all my bliss and all my woe that foundst me poor at first and keepst me so thou guide by which the nobler arts excel thou nurse of every virtue fare thee well farewell and oh whereer thy voice be tried on tornos cliffs or pambamarcas side whether where equinoctial fervours glow or winter wraps the polar world in snow still let thy voice prevailing over time redress the rigours of th inclement clime aid slighted truth with thy persuasive strain teach erring man to spurn the rage of gain teach him that states of native strength possessed though very poor may still be very blessed that trades proud empire hastes to swift decay as ocean sweeps the laboured mole away while selfdependent power can time defy as rocks resist the billows and the sky,4,1730,1774,1
